      "In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives on the official website. A total of 4,532 people voted in the 2022 election..\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the voting period ends, the projects are ranked according to the number of votes received. The winning projects are then selected using a greedy algorithm: starting with the project that received the most votes, projects are successively added in order of votes, as long as the available budget allows. \n",
      "\n",
      "When the remaining budget is not sufficient to fund the next project on the list, the algorithm skips to the next one that can be funded, and so on, until the total budget of 8,000,000 euros is exhausted.\n",

      "Description: Even though notable efforts have already been made, wanting to develop the modal share of bicycles in transportation requires a significant increase in bike parking options, especially in the city center. Parking spaces are very insufficient around Capitole Square, Wilson Square, St Pierre Square, Arnaud Bernard Square, around St Sernin, Carnot Boulevard, Strasbourg Boulevard, Arcole Boulevard, Alsace-Lorraine Street, Mirepoix Street, Pargamini√®res Street, R√©musat Street, Taur Street, Gambetta Street, etc. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: As part of its urban development projects, the Community systematically integrates fixtures for bike parking. The deployment of urban furniture such as bike racks in the city center is carried out according to the needs reported by local residents and users (requests to the District Mayor or the AlloToulouse platform 05 61 222 222), subject to the opinion of the Architecte des B√¢timents de France and the availability of already very constrained public space. Within this framework, it is proposed to install, at a minimum, fifty bike racks per year in District 1.\n",

      "Based on:\n",
      "- Your knowledge of Toulouse, its urban context, and its social and environmental issues\n",
      "- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n",
      "- Typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n",
      "\n",
      "Please answer the following questions regarding this project:\n",
      "1. What is a reasonable estimate of the number of votes this project could receive?\n",
      "2. What would its expected position be in the final ranking?\n",
      "\n",
      "Please answer in the form of a JSON dictionary with the following keys:\n",

This project, in adaptation to climate change, includes: - eco-mobility with the bicycle lane and the removal of parking spaces. Moreover, the presence of 5 private and 3 public parking lots meets the needs of the residents - the creation of green islands (without affecting the networks) is part of nature in the city and biodiversity: creating shade for the summer. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The development of a bicycle lane from the Canal du Midi to Place Belfort can be considered. Such a project would remove about 34 parking spaces, 2 delivery spots, 1 space for Persons with Reduced Mobility, and bicycle parking. The terrace area of an establishment would also need to be modified. However, the greening of the street cannot be considered due to the presence of numerous networks: their diversion requires a budget incompatible with that allocated under this participatory budget. Finally, the \"Flowers on My Wall\" initiative can be proposed to residents to green this street. This initiative, after agreement from the concerned property owners, is subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and pedestrian continuity to be respected. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the technical services of the city hall and the metropolis, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

To mitigate the extreme heat on this street during summer, it would be interesting to replace parking spaces with planting pits to accommodate large trees along the entire length of the street, thereby creating a true canopy. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Planting (14/15 trees) in parking spaces may be considered on the odd-numbered side, subject to the approval of the architect of the buildings of France. On the even-numbered side, the presence of numerous networks does not allow for the creation of pits to accommodate trees. This project would eliminate about 15 parking spaces. On the occasion of this redevelopment, the implementation of a bicycle lane on the even-numbered side can also be studied. Finally, the \"Flowers on My Wall\" initiative can be offered to residents to green this street. This initiative, after agreement from the concerned owners, is subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and pedestrian continuity to be respected. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the technical services of the city hall and the metropolis, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

         "- **Urban and Environmental Context**: Toulouse, being a major urban area, faces typical urban challenges such as heat islands and limited green spaces. Projects that aim to increase greenery and reduce heat are likely to resonate well with the urban population, especially in densely built areas.\n  \n- **Project Appeal**: The project proposes to replace parking spaces with greenery and potentially add a bicycle lane, which aligns with broader environmental and sustainable urban mobility trends. This could attract votes from environmentally conscious residents and those favoring non-car transportation.\n\n- **District Characteristics**: The project is located in District 3, which includes diverse neighborhoods. The impact of losing parking spaces might be a concern for some voters, potentially reducing the project's appeal to car-dependent residents.\n\n- **Cost and Budget Constraints**: With a cost of 200,000 euros, the project is moderately priced within the typical range of participatory budgeting projects. This makes it more likely to be funded within the 8,000,000 euros total budget, assuming it garners enough votes.\n\n- **Voting Dynamics**: Given that each voter can select up to three projects, projects with broad appeal and visible impact often receive higher votes. The environmental focus of this project could place it in the mid to high range of popularity.\n\n- **Historical Voting Patterns**: Projects that address immediate and visible concerns like heat mitigation during summer tend to perform well. However, the removal of parking could be a contentious issue, potentially affecting its overall vote count.\n\n- **Competition**: The number of competing projects and their themes will also influence the ranking.

Making the street more pleasant, conducive to the presence of life, and contributing to the thermal regulation of the neighborhood (micro-climatic rebalancing). A few simple proposals, whose effectiveness is well established, include: Tree planting and vegetation through adapted strata. De-impermeabilization and reduction of car parking spaces. Biological reactivation of targeted soils. Increase in bicycle parking spaces. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is accepted, subject to feasibility in view of the presence of underground networks. Similarly, the form that this greening will take will be specified according to the constraints of the networks: tree planting, planters with climbing plants on supports, or standard-formed trees. These developments will result in the removal of about 17 car parking spaces. This project will also be submitted for review by the Architecte des B√¢timents de France. Additionally, the \"Flowers on My Wall\" initiative can be offered to residents to green these streets. However, the agreement of each owner is mandatory to green their front facade. The owner must also commit to maintaining the pits over the long term. Moreover, this initiative will be subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and the need to maintain pedestrian continuity. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the city and metropolitan technical services.

Projects that aim to improve living conditions and environmental quality in such districts tend to attract a good number of votes due to the direct impact on residents' daily lives.\n\n- **Cost vs. Budget**: The project cost of 250,000 euros is relatively moderate when compared to the total available budget of 8,000,000 euros. This makes it more likely to be funded without exhausting the budget, allowing it to compete effectively against more expensive projects.\n\n- **Voting Dynamics**: Based on previous participatory budgeting elections, projects that enhance community spaces and environmental conditions tend to perform well. The ability to vote for up to 3 projects per voter also increases the likelihood of this project receiving votes, as voters can support multiple initiatives without prioritizing one over another.\n\n- **Technical and Regulatory Feasibility**: The project has been accepted subject to feasibility, which might introduce some uncertainty. However, the detailed planning and the involvement of the Architecte des B√¢timents de France suggest a serious proposal that can sway voters looking for well-thought-out projects.\n\n- **Social Impact**: The reduction of car parking spaces might be seen as a negative by some voters who rely on car transportation, potentially affecting the number of votes. However, the increase in bicycle parking spaces and overall greening can be viewed positively by environmentally conscious voters.\n\n- **Historical Data and Estimation**: Without specific historical voting data for similar projects, estimating the exact number of votes is challenging.

         "- **Local Interest and Relevance**: The project targets a specific and well-used area in Toulouse, which could increase local interest and support. Avenue des Minimes is a significant urban area, suggesting a higher local population that might be directly impacted and thus more likely to vote for the project.\n\n- **Environmental Appeal**: The project's focus on greening and biodiversity can attract votes from environmentally conscious residents, which is a growing demographic in urban settings like Toulouse.\n\n- **Visibility and Utility**: The project addresses an existing problem (dumping grounds for garbage) and proposes a visually appealing solution, which can be a strong motivator for votes as it directly improves the quality of life and aesthetics of the neighborhood.\n\n- **Cost Efficiency**: With a relatively low cost of 23,000 euros, the project is affordable within the context of the total budget of 8 million euros. This makes it more likely to be funded even after several other projects have been selected, assuming it garners enough votes.\n\n- **Comparison with Past Projects**: Analyzing previous participatory budgeting outcomes, projects with a clear, direct benefit to a large number of residents or those improving daily life conditions tend to perform well.\n\n- **Voting Dynamics**: Given that each voter can select up to three projects, projects that are well-promoted and resonate with a broad audience or address pressing issues tend to secure more votes.\n\n- **Project Specifics and Modifications**: The suggestion by city services to modify the project to include ground cover plants and protective fencing instead of just shrubs might affect the perception of the project's feasibility and effectiveness, potentially influencing voter decisions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 350,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [300, 400],\n  \"expected_position\": 15\n}\n```",

This relevance can increase its appeal and potential votes.\n\n- **Cost Efficiency**: With a relatively low cost of 50,000 euros, the project is cost-effective compared to other potential projects with higher budgets. This efficiency might make it more attractive to voters who prefer to see the budget spread across multiple smaller projects.\n\n- **District Characteristics**: The project is located in a district that includes diverse neighborhoods, potentially affecting a large number of residents. Projects that impact more people directly tend to receive more votes.\n\n- **Safety and Accessibility Improvements**: Projects focusing on safety and multimodal transportation are increasingly popular, reflecting broader social and environmental concerns. This trend could boost the project's voting potential.\n\n- **Comparison with Previous Elections**: Analyzing past participatory budgeting results, projects with a clear, direct benefit and moderate cost often perform well in terms of votes.\n\n- **Voting Dynamics**: Given that each voter can select up to three projects, there is a high likelihood that this project will be chosen as one of the options by voters concerned with urban mobility and safety.\n\n- **Estimation of Votes and Position**: Based on the factors above, the project could be estimated to receive a moderate to high number of votes.

Similarly, the form that this greening will take will be refined according to the constraints of the networks: planting of trees, planters with climbing plants on supports, or standard-formed trees. These developments will result in the removal of about 17 car parking spaces. This project will also be submitted for review by the Architecte des B√¢timents de France. Additionally, the \"Flowers on My Wall\" initiative can be offered to residents to green these streets. However, the agreement of each owner is mandatory to green their front facade. The owner must also commit to maintaining the pits in the long term. Moreover, this initiative will be subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and the need to maintain pedestrian continuity. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the city and metropolitan technical services, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

This will also beautify a street used by schoolchildren and high school students who are sensitive to this important issue for their future. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Due to the many networks present underground, the greening of L√©o Lagrange Street is highly constrained. Planting a line of trees along the entire length of the street would exceed the financial envelope of the participatory budget. Therefore, it is proposed to remove the asphalt from all the parking spaces on the street, with the installation of grassed cellular paving. This would recreate soil porosity without losing any parking spaces. Additionally, trees could be planted sporadically if spaces free of networks and other constraints allow it. Furthermore, the \"Flowers on My Wall\" initiative can be offered to residents to green this street. However, the agreement of each owner is mandatory to green their front facade. The owner must also commit to maintaining the pits in the long term. Moreover, this initiative will be subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and the need to maintain pedestrian continuity. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the city and metropolitan technical services, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

The project's focus on connectivity and accessibility could appeal to a wide demographic, including students, healthcare professionals, and families.\n\n- **Cost vs. Budget**: The project cost of 240,000 euros is relatively moderate within the total budget of 8 million euros. This makes it more likely to be funded without exhausting the budget, allowing for potentially more projects to be approved.\n\n- **Voting Trends**: Based on previous participatory budgeting outcomes, projects that enhance infrastructure without causing significant disruption tend to receive favorable support. The project's non-invasive approach to enhancing existing structures could be a positive factor.\n\n- **Competition**: The number of competing projects and their nature (cost, impact, and appeal) will significantly influence the ranking and votes. Without specific details on other projects, a conservative estimate is prudent.\n\n- **Historical Data and Estimation**: Assuming a similar voter turnout as in 2022 (4,532 voters) and considering the project's appeal and cost, a reasonable estimate of votes might be around the lower to mid-range of total votes, factoring in the possibility of each voter selecting up to 3 projects.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 600,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [400, 800],\n  \"expected_position\": 10\n}\n```",

However, its appeal might be limited to those living in close proximity to the area.\n\n- **Cost-Effectiveness**: With a low cost of 1000 euros, the project is highly affordable relative to the total budget of 8,000,000 euros. This could make it more likely to be funded even if it doesn't receive a top ranking in votes, as it represents a minimal financial risk.\n\n- **Visibility and Urgency**: Projects that address more visible or urgent city-wide issues tend to attract more votes. The mosquito trap project, while beneficial, might not be perceived as urgent compared to other proposals that impact a larger demographic or address more critical infrastructure needs.\n\n- **Historical Voting Patterns**: Analyzing past participatory budgeting results could provide insights, but typically, smaller, localized projects receive fewer votes than larger, more impactful ones. However, they also face less competition in their specific categories or districts.\n\n- **Project Support and Promotion**: The level of organization and promotion by the project proposers can significantly influence the number of votes. Active campaigning within the community and online could enhance visibility and support.\n\n- **Comparative Analysis**: Considering the total number of voters (4,532 in 2022) and typical vote distribution, a small, localized project might attract a modest portion of the total votes, especially if there are competing projects with broader appeal.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 150,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [100, 200],\n  \"expected_position\": 30\n}\n```",

Traffic is increasingly heavy on Sang de Serp Road and through the small adjacent streets (notably Bessemer Road) as drivers try to avoid the congested main roads. It has become very difficult and especially very dangerous to cross when one is a pedestrian or cyclist. Beyond proposing security measures, I am raising the alarm about the danger of this location for pedestrians and cyclists. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Possible security enhancement on a raised platform.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Toulouse, its urban context, and its social and environmental issues\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- Typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

         "- **Relevance and Urgency**: The project addresses a significant safety concern for pedestrians and cyclists, which is a pressing issue in urban areas, especially in busy districts like the 8th in Toulouse. Safety projects tend to resonate well with urban voters who experience these issues daily.\n\n- **District Characteristics**: The 8th district includes diverse neighborhoods with varying traffic and pedestrian dynamics. The specific area mentioned (Henri Bessemer Road and Chemin du Sang de Serp) is noted for its traffic issues, which likely affects a large number of residents and commuters.\n\n- **Cost Efficiency**: With a project cost of 100,000 euros, this initiative is relatively affordable compared to other urban infrastructure projects. This cost-effectiveness could appeal to voters who are conscious of budget allocation efficiency.\n\n- **Voter Engagement**: Historical data from previous participatory budgeting elections indicates that projects with a clear, direct benefit to community safety and mobility tend to attract higher voter interest. Given the project's focus and moderate cost, it is likely to be well-supported.\n\n- **Competition and Comparison**: The project's success also depends on the nature of competing projects in the same election cycle. Assuming a typical range of projects, a safety-related project in a busy district could be expected to perform well.\n\n- **Estimation of Votes**: Based on the factors above, the project could be estimated to receive a moderate to high number of votes. Considering the total number of voters and typical distribution, a reasonable estimate might be around the upper quartile of the voting distribution.\n\n- **Ranking Prediction**: Given the project's relevance, cost, and potential voter base, it is likely to rank well, possibly within the top 20% of projects, especially if the total number of projects is large and varies in scope and impact.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 800,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [600, 1000],\n  \"expected_position\": 15\n}\n```",

One very dangerous point remains at the end of Rue de Metz, to cross Quai de Tounis towards Pont Neuf. Bikes coming from Rue de Metz cannot see cars turning left into Quai de Tounis from the same street. A separate bike traffic light, offset from the car lights, would be necessary for safe crossing for all users. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal as formulated cannot be accepted. Indeed, by regulation, the bike crossing is managed by the pedestrian light. As with all intersections with traffic lights, when the pedestrian light is green, vehicles in the left-turn lane also have a green light and must be vigilant for crossing bikes and pedestrians. Moreover, a three-color bike traffic light cannot be installed because this equipment requires a phase during which the bike light is on. This is not feasible due to the significant impact on traffic on Rue de Metz. However, an experiment can be set up on this pedestrian light with the installation of a bike crossing box: this will allow for a better understanding of the intersection by cyclists.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Toulouse, its urban context, and its social and environmental issues\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- Typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

         "- **Urban Context and Project Relevance**: Toulouse, being a city with a significant number of cyclists and ongoing urban mobility projects, has a population that is generally supportive of improvements to cycling infrastructure. The project's focus on safety at a busy intersection could appeal to a broad audience, including cyclists and pedestrians.\n\n- **Project Cost and Feasibility**: The project's low cost (2000.0 ‚Ç¨) makes it an attractive option in the participatory budgeting process, as it allows for potentially many other projects to be funded alongside it. Its feasibility, despite regulatory challenges, is enhanced by the proposed experimental approach.\n\n- **Voting Dynamics**: In previous participatory budgeting elections, projects with a focus on safety and low costs tend to receive a higher number of votes. Given that each voter can select up to three projects, cost-effective projects that address urgent needs are likely to be prioritized by voters.\n\n- **District Influence**: The project is located in District 1, which includes central and historically significant areas like Capitole and Carmes. These areas are densely populated and have active community engagement, which could translate into higher voting participation for local projects.\n\n- **Competition and Budget Constraints**: The total budget and the number of competing projects will influence the final ranking. However, given the project's low cost, it is less likely to be skipped over due to budget constraints in the selection process.\n\n- **Estimated Votes and Position**: Based on the factors above, the project could be expected to receive a moderate to high number of votes, placing it in a favorable position in the ranking, especially considering its relevance, cost, and the district's active community.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 350,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [300, 400],\n  \"expected_position\": 15\n}\n```",

This cost allows for the possibility of funding alongside other projects.\n\n3. **District Coverage**: The project covers multiple key areas in the Stare Miasto district, which is a central and highly populated area. This broad coverage likely increases the project's appeal to a larger voter base.\n\n4. **Voter Behavior**: In participatory budgeting, projects that address widespread issues like transportation and safety tend to receive higher voter support. The focus on improving existing infrastructure could appeal to daily commuters and residents concerned about safety and accessibility.\n\n5. **Competition with Other Projects**: The project's success in ranking also depends on the nature and appeal of competing projects.

         "1. **Project Theme and Appeal**: The project \"Budki dla kot√≥w wolno ≈ºyjƒÖcych\" focuses on creating shelters for stray cats. This theme may attract animal lovers and environmentally conscious voters, which is a moderately niche but passionate demographic.\n\n2. **Cost Efficiency**: With a cost of ‚Ç¨70,000, the project is relatively affordable compared to larger infrastructure projects. This could make it more appealing to voters who prefer to see multiple smaller projects funded.\n\n3. **District-Specific Interest**: The project is located in the Psie Pole district. The level of local community engagement and the specific needs or affinity towards animal welfare in this district would influence the voting.\n\n4. **Comparison with Past Projects**: Analyzing past participatory budgeting results, projects with a clear community benefit and moderate costs tend to perform well. However, highly specialized projects (like those targeting animal welfare) might not receive the highest votes but still maintain a solid backing.\n\n5. **Voting Dynamics**: Given that each resident can vote for up to three projects, projects that are not polarizing and have a broad appeal tend to gather more votes as second or third choices.\n\n6. **Budget Constraints in Ranking**: The project's cost allows it to fit comfortably within the total budget when considering the greedy algorithm used for final selection. Projects under ‚Ç¨100,000 often have a better chance of being funded after the top few expensive projects are selected.\n\n7. **Estimated Votes and Rank**: Based on these factors, the project might receive a moderate number of votes, placing it in the middle tier of the ranking.

         "1. **Project Relevance**: The project addresses a significant safety and accessibility issue in the Krzyki district, which is a densely populated area. Projects that enhance pedestrian safety and infrastructure typically attract a good amount of community support.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: With a cost of ‚Ç¨1,000,000, the project is substantial but not excessively expensive in the context of the total budget of ‚Ç¨8,000,000. This makes it a feasible choice without consuming an excessive portion of the budget.\n\n3. **Community Impact**: The project directly impacts daily life, especially for families and children, which can drive higher voter interest and support.\n\n4. **District Characteristics**: Krzyki is one of the larger districts in Wroclaw, potentially having a larger voter base which could translate into more votes for the project.\n\n5. **Previous Voting Trends**: Projects with a clear and direct benefit to a large number of residents, especially in terms of safety and infrastructure, tend to perform well in participatory budgeting settings.\n\n6. **Competition with Other Projects**: The final rank will also depend on the nature and appeal of other competing projects. If there are many high-cost projects, this project's moderate cost might make it more likely to be funded.\n\n7. **Estimation of Votes and Rank**: Based on these factors, the project might attract a significant number of votes, placing it in a competitive position for funding. The exact number of votes and rank would depend on specific voter turnout and the array of other project proposals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 4500,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [3000, 6000],\n  \"expected_rank\": 5\n}\n```",

         "1. **Project Appeal and Relevance**: The project proposes an educational and recreational space, which is likely to attract families, educators, and science enthusiasts. Given Wroclaw's existing infrastructure like Humanitarium, this project fills a niche for a centrally located educational recreation area.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Considerations**: With a cost of ‚Ç¨1,000,000, the project is significant but not excessively expensive, making it a feasible choice within the total budget of ‚Ç¨8,000,000. It's likely to be considered for funding if it garners enough votes.\n\n3. **District and Demographics**: Psie Pole, the district for the proposed project, is a residential area that could benefit from such community-focused developments. Projects in residential districts can often attract local support.\n\n4. **Unique Selling Point**: The project's focus on physics and custom-made installations offers a unique educational aspect not widely available in Wroclaw, potentially increasing its appeal.\n\n5. **Voting Dynamics**: Typically, projects that combine educational value with community benefits tend to perform well in participatory budgeting settings. The voting system allowing up to 3 votes per resident also supports the possibility of this project receiving a high number of votes as it does not force a zero-sum choice among competing interests.\n\n6. **Comparison with Past Projects**: Analyzing previous participatory budgeting outcomes, projects with a strong community and educational focus, especially those enhancing public spaces, tend to rank higher in votes.\n\n7. **Estimated Votes and Rank**: Based on the factors above, the project is likely to receive a substantial number of votes, placing it in a competitive position for funding.

         "1. **Project Appeal**: The project, aimed at creating a space-themed playground, is likely to attract families and children, a significant demographic in any community. Given its innovative and educational angle, it could garner considerable interest.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: With a cost of ‚Ç¨1,000,000, the project takes a substantial portion of the total budget (‚Ç¨8,000,000). This could affect its feasibility in the final selection if there are many other popular but less expensive projects.\n\n3. **District**: Located in Krzyki, one of the larger and more populated districts of Wroclaw, the project could receive a higher number of votes due to the larger local population.\n\n4. **Previous Initiatives**: The mention of a previously successful initiative in the same location (2015 participatory budgeting) suggests community interest and engagement, which could translate into higher votes for continuing development.\n\n5. **Voting Dynamics**: Typically, projects that resonate well with a broad audience, especially those benefiting children and community engagement, tend to perform well in participatory budgeting.\n\n6. **Competition**: The final rank will heavily depend on the nature and appeal of competing projects. If there are many appealing projects with lower costs, this project might be ranked lower despite high votes.\n\n7. **Estimation Methodology**: Based on typical voting patterns, the appeal of the project, and its competition, an estimate can be made.

This makes it a feasible choice under the budget constraints.\n\n3. **District Influence**: Krzyki is one of the larger districts in Wroclaw, potentially providing a larger voter base which could positively influence the number of votes the project receives.\n\n4. **Unique Appeal**: The project's focus on restoring a historic vehicle that has been a part of city celebrations may appeal to a broad audience, including both older residents with a nostalgic connection and younger populations interested in unique urban experiences.\n\n5. **Competition and Voter Behavior**: The number of votes can also be influenced by the number and type of competing projects. Projects with broader appeal or lower costs might attract more votes. However, the unique nature of this project might still ensure it receives a significant number of votes.\n\n6. **Voting Dynamics**: Typically, projects that resonate with a wide audience or serve a practical purpose tend to rank higher. The emotional and historical value of this project adds to its potential to secure a high number of votes.\n\n7. **Rank Estimation**: Given the project's moderate cost and significant cultural value, it is likely to be ranked relatively high, though not necessarily at the top, as projects with lower costs or more immediate practical benefits might surpass it in a budget-constrained ranking.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3500,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [3000, 4000],\n  \"expected_rank\": 15\n}\n```",

         "1. **Project Relevance**: The project addresses pedestrian safety and comfort, which is a significant concern in urban areas like Wroclaw. This relevance could attract a higher number of votes from residents who prioritize safety and urban mobility improvements.\n\n2. **Innovative Approach**: The use of \"all-green\" pedestrian signals and speed-monitoring lights instead of traditional speed cameras could appeal to both pedestrians and drivers, potentially increasing its popularity.\n\n3. **Cost Consideration**: At ‚Ç¨650,000, the project is moderately expensive. While not the most costly, its budget could affect its feasibility under the total available budget of ‚Ç¨8,000,000, especially if there are many other competing projects.\n\n4. **District-Specific Impact**: Located in Psie Pole, the project might receive strong support locally but might not resonate as strongly across other districts unless the benefits are perceived as city-wide.\n\n5. **Historical Voting Trends**: Typically, projects that enhance safety and integrate technology tend to perform well in participatory budgeting settings, assuming they are well-publicized and the community is engaged effectively.\n\n6. **Competition**: The final rank will also depend heavily on the nature and appeal of other projects submitted for the same budgeting period.

It's neither too small to be considered insignificant nor too large to be deemed unaffordable, striking a good balance.\n\n3. **Location and District**: Located in the Fabryczna district, near key transport links and the stadium, the project is strategically placed. This district's population and the project's proximity to major venues could drive higher voter interest.\n\n4. **Environmental and Safety Benefits**: The project promotes environmental sustainability and safety, which are appealing aspects in urban settings, potentially attracting votes from environmentally conscious citizens.\n\n5. **Historical Voting Trends**: Assuming typical participatory budgeting dynamics, projects that address both immediate local concerns (like traffic and parking) and broader benefits (like environmental impact) tend to perform well.\n\n6. **Competition**: The project's success also depends on the nature of competing proposals. If there are no significantly more appealing or larger-scale projects within the same budget cycle, it stands a better chance of ranking higher.\n\n7. **Voter Engagement**: The level of community engagement and promotion around the project could also influence its vote count. Active campaigning could place it higher in the rankings.\n\nBased on these points, here is the estimated outcome:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 4500,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [3000, 6000],\n  \"expected_rank\": 10\n}\n```",

If there are many high-cost projects, a moderately priced project like this one might stand a better chance of being funded.\n\n6. **Historical Data and Trends**: Based on previous participatory budgeting outcomes in Wroclaw, projects with a clear, direct benefit to a large number of residents or that improve aesthetics and environmental conditions tend to perform well.\n\n7. **Estimation of Votes and Rank**: Considering the factors above, the project might attract a significant number of votes, placing it in a competitive position unless overshadowed by more appealing or critical projects.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3200,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [2800, 3600],\n  \"expected_rank\": 15\n}\n```",

         "1. **Project Appeal**: The project \"Toskania we Wroc≈Çawiu\" aims to beautify the area around Wroc≈Çaw's Market Square by adding decorative flower pots and hanging planters. This could appeal to residents who prioritize urban beautification and green spaces.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: With a cost of ‚Ç¨350,000, the project is moderately expensive. This cost is significant but not so high as to preclude its selection, given the total budget of ‚Ç¨8,000,000.\n\n3. **District Influence**: The project is located in the Krzyki district, one of the populous areas of Wroc≈Çaw. Projects in populous districts might receive more votes due to a higher number of residents who are directly impacted.\n\n4. **Environmental and Aesthetic Value**: The project addresses the lack of greenery in a historic area, which is a common concern in urban settings.

This area is a central and historically significant part of the city, likely attracting both residents and tourists. Projects in central locations generally receive higher visibility and potentially more votes.\n\n2. **Project Cost**: At ‚Ç¨250,000, the project is moderately expensive but not excessively so, making it a feasible choice within the total budget of ‚Ç¨8,000,000. Projects with moderate costs often strike a balance between perceived value and feasibility, which can appeal to voters.\n\n3. **Community Engagement**: Outdoor chess could serve as a community hub, promoting social interaction and outdoor activities, which are generally well-received in urban settings. This social aspect might increase its attractiveness to voters.\n\n4. **Historical Voting Trends**: In participatory budgeting, projects that enhance public spaces typically perform well. Given the project's nature and location, it aligns with successful themes from past elections.\n\n5. **Competition and Diversity of Projects**: The number of competing projects and their nature could influence the votes. Assuming a typical year with a diverse range of proposals, this project would need to stand out in its utility and appeal.\n\n6. **Voter Demographics**: The demographics of voters in Stare Miasto, which likely includes a mix of younger individuals, families, and older residents, could see the value in a project promoting an intellectual and physically accessible activity.\n\n7. **Estimation of Votes**: Based on these factors, the project might attract a significant portion of the electorate, but not be the top vote-getter due to its niche appeal compared to more universally demanded projects like infrastructure improvements or broader recreational facilities.\n\n8. **Ranking Prediction**: Given the cost and appeal, it's likely to be selected unless several cheaper projects with higher votes consume the budget first. It might not be the first few selected due to its moderate cost but stands a good chance of being funded.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3200,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [2800, 3600],\n  \"expected_rank\": 15\n}\n```",

         "1. **Relevance and Impact**: The project addresses accessibility for visually impaired and physically disabled individuals, enhancing their ability to navigate key tourist and cultural sites in Wroclaw. This focus on inclusivity likely appeals to a broad audience, including those directly affected, their families, and advocates for greater accessibility.\n\n2. **Location**: The project is situated in Stare Miasto, a central and historically significant district. This visibility and the high foot traffic could translate into higher interest and support from local residents and businesses.\n\n3. **Cost**: At ‚Ç¨130,000, the project is moderately priced compared to other potential participatory budgeting projects. This cost is neither too low to be considered trivial nor too high to be deemed unfeasible, striking a balance that might appeal to voters.\n\n4. **Social Value**: The project has a strong social component, promoting inclusivity and equal access, which are increasingly valued in urban development. This could resonate well with a socially conscious electorate.\n\n5. **Voter Behavior**: In participatory budgeting, projects that demonstrate clear, tangible benefits and address the needs of a specific community tend to perform well. The tactile maps project clearly outlines its benefits and target group.\n\n6. **Competition**: Without details on competing projects, it's challenging to predict exact rankings. However, projects with a social or inclusive angle typically garner significant support in participatory settings.\n\n7. **Historical Data**: Assuming past trends where socially impactful projects receive substantial support, this project could be expected to perform well, although exact vote counts are speculative without specific historical voting data for similar projects.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 4500,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [3000, 6000],\n  \"expected_rank\": 15\n}\n```",

      "The concept of the Park in Ma≈õlice was designed based on a survey conducted among its current users. It takes into account two main target groups: families with children and young, active sports enthusiasts. Currently, this area is perceived by residents as a green space‚Äîunfortunately, neglected. Given the development of the estate and the need to create new meeting places for residents, as well as Wroc≈Çaw's efforts to earn the title of European Green Capital, this area should gain a new look.\n",
      "\n",
      "The park development project includes paths, prepared based on the state of tree cover and potential costs of clearing the trails to a minimum width of 2.5 m‚Äîcycling, running, and walking paths‚Äîleveled and prepared for stroller access. Additionally, the project includes health trail routes connected by crossings made of wooden bridges, culverts, and balance beams. The paths will be connected to sandy squares where wooden play equipment and willow wigwams will be located. The park's hill will also be utilized‚Äîit will be planted with a spiral hedge, and plastic slides will be built into its sides. At the top, there will be a viewing point with a circular gazebo and swing benches.\n",
      "\n",
      "The park paths will be equipped with a series of educational and sensory boards. Existing blackberry hedges will be densified with raspberry bushes in various varieties and fruiting seasons. The concept also includes the development of two water reservoirs. Two crossings over them in the form of wooden bridges are planned. Near one of the ponds, there will be a spot for exercises with a shock-absorbing surface and a place for outdoor gym equipment. The area will also feature two fire pits, gazebos, benches, and wooden loungers made from tree trunks.\n",

         "1. **District and Demographics**: Krzyki is one of the more populous districts of Wroclaw, suggesting a higher potential voter base. Projects in populous districts often receive more votes due to greater local interest and impact.\n\n2. **Project Appeal**: The project targets a broad audience including families, sports enthusiasts, and nature lovers, which can increase its appeal and potential votes.\n\n3. **Environmental and Social Relevance**: The project aligns with Wroclaw's ambition to become the European Green Capital, enhancing its attractiveness and relevance, potentially increasing voter support.\n\n4. **Cost and Budget Constraints**: With a cost of 1,000,000 ‚Ç¨, the project is significant but not excessively expensive, allowing it to potentially be funded within the total budget of 4,500,000 ‚Ç¨ without excluding too many other projects.\n\n5. **Historical Voting Trends**: Typically, projects that address both environmental improvement and community development tend to perform well in participatory budgeting settings.\n\n6. **Competition and Similar Projects**: The rank and number of votes could be influenced by the presence of competing or similar projects in the same voting cycle.

Unfortunately, Dawida Street lacks decent infrastructure - sidewalks (the existing concrete ones are in poor condition and are uncomfortable to use, especially in winter), bus shelters (even just to protect against rain), benches, street lamps, trash bins, or clear timetables (there are several stops and if someone is not familiar with them, i.e., does not know from which stop a particular carrier departs, it can be a bit confusing). Changes would enable more pleasant and easier use of this bus loop.\nI qualify this project as city-wide, as residents from various parts of the city and from nearby towns use this infrastructure.\nP.S. I heard that the city plans to change the location of the stops for private carriers - if this is the case, please inform me and possibly then the project will be withdrawn.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

         "1. **City-wide Impact**: The project impacts a broad user base, including residents of Wroclaw and nearby towns, which could increase its appeal and the number of votes.\n2. **Infrastructure Need**: The lack of proper infrastructure at a busy bus loop suggests a clear and urgent need, likely resonating with daily commuters and enhancing voter support.\n3. **Cost vs. Budget**: The project cost (250,000 ‚Ç¨) is moderate relative to the total budget (4,500,000 ‚Ç¨), making it a feasible choice without consuming a disproportionate share of the budget.\n4. **District Influence**: Located in ≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie, a central and heavily frequented district, the project could see higher visibility and voting due to the larger population and traffic.\n5. **Comparative Analysis**: Typically, projects with a clear, broad impact and moderate cost tend to perform well in participatory budgeting settings. Assuming a competitive field, this project might not be the top vote-getter but could rank well among the top due to its practical benefits and reasonable cost.\n6. **Voting Dynamics**: Given the voting system allows choosing up to three projects, voters might prioritize projects like this one that offer tangible benefits to a wide demographic.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3200,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [2800, 3600],\n  \"expected_rank\": 5\n}\n```",

It is an eco-friendly solution used in modern large cities. The project plans to create 80 parking spaces. Due to the proximity of the A8 motorway entrance to the city and the Pilczyce loop (100m), the parking is ideally located for use by people coming from outside Wroc≈Çaw, who will leave their car in the parking lot and switch to public transport (tram lines: 33, 3, 10, 20; bus line: 128). Additionally, the spaces can be used by people driving to mass events organized at the Municipal Stadium (300m). The implementation of the project will increase the safety of residents and cars parked during events at the stadium. It will also improve the image of the city of Wroc≈Çaw (especially during stadium events). It will prevent the devastation of green areas. Currently, during mass events at the stadium, due to cars parked on the road, dangerous situations and collisions occur. Due to the lack of space, cars are unable to pass or turn around. Often, they have to back out of the alley up to 200 m.

         "1. **Project Appeal and Relevance**: The \"Park & ride\" project addresses a common urban issue of parking and traffic congestion, especially during events, which is a significant concern in large cities like Wroclaw. Its proximity to major transport links and the stadium increases its relevance and potential appeal to a broad audience.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: With a cost of 750,000 ‚Ç¨, the project is moderately expensive but not prohibitively so, allowing for the possibility of funding within the available budget of 4,500,000 ‚Ç¨. This cost positions it well among other potential projects that might either be far cheaper or significantly more expensive.\n\n3. **District Influence**: Located in the Fabryczna district, which is a significant and populous part of Wroclaw, the project is likely to attract attention from local residents who directly benefit from reduced traffic and improved parking facilities.\n\n4. **Environmental and Safety Benefits**: The project promotes environmental benefits by reducing the need for cars in the city center and enhancing safety during stadium events, aligning with contemporary urban planning trends towards sustainability and safety.\n\n5. **Voting Dynamics and Historical Data**: Based on typical participatory budgeting dynamics, projects that address widespread issues like traffic and public safety tend to perform well. Assuming a moderate level of competition and no extremely high-impact projects overshadowing it, this project should attract a substantial number of votes.\n\n6. **Estimation Methodology**: Considering the factors above, a reasonable estimate of votes might be derived from similar past projects in Wroclaw or comparable cities. The project's broad appeal, moderate cost, and significant impact suggest it would be in the upper-middle range of vote-getters.\n\n7. **Ranking Prediction**: Given the cost-to-benefit ratio and the project's appeal, it is likely to rank well unless there are numerous other projects with either a significantly lower cost or higher immediate impact. The project's moderate cost allows it to be feasibly funded within the total budget, assuming normal distribution of project costs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3200,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [2800, 3600],\n  \"expected_rank\": 5\n}\n```",

This widespread placement can increase the perceived value and relevance of the project among voters.\n\n3. **Cost Efficiency**: With a relatively modest cost of 50,000 ‚Ç¨, the project is affordable compared to larger-scale infrastructure projects. This cost efficiency might make it more attractive to voters who prefer funding multiple smaller projects.\n\n4. **Cultural and Educational Value**: The project has a strong cultural and educational component, aiming to remind and educate about past hardships. Projects with educational value tend to be popular in participatory budgeting contexts.\n\n5. **District Influence**: Located in Krzyki, one of the populous districts of Wroclaw, the project might garner significant local support, which can translate into a higher number of votes.\n\n6. **Comparative Analysis**: Considering typical voting patterns and project appeals in previous participatory budgeting cycles, projects with historical and city-wide significance, modest cost, and educational impact often perform well.\n\n7. **Estimation and Ranking**: Based on these factors, the project is likely to receive a substantial number of votes, placing it in a competitive position for funding, though exact ranking might depend on the nature and appeal of competing proposals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3200,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [2800, 3600],\n  \"expected_rank\": 15\n}\n```",

The main change will be switching the signals to an \"all-green\" mode for pedestrians ‚Äì meaning that when there are no cars on the road, the green light will continuously be on at crosswalks, allowing pedestrians to cross freely without having to press buttons and wait. The change occurs only when a column of cars approaches. The second feature would be slowing lights - when a car approaches an intersection or a pedestrian crossing with traffic lights, its speed is monitored by cameras, and if it is driving too fast, the light turns red. The green light comes back on once it reduces speed - if it does not, the camera records the moment of running the red light, and only then is a fine issued. This system is much more driver-friendly than the traditional speed camera - if someone's foot lingers on the gas pedal, they do not immediately receive a fine, but a warning in the form of a red light, and only if they ignore it are they penalized. It is also a more effective solution - it reduces speed in the most dangerous places, namely at intersections and pedestrian crossings. Slowing lights are operational in Wroc≈Çaw at the intersection of ≈ölƒô≈ºna and Weigla, so this is not a novelty in our city.\nProposals:\n1. Krakowska ‚Äì pedestrian crossing (signal no. 231)\n2.

         "1. **Project Relevance and Appeal**: The project addresses traffic and pedestrian safety, a significant concern in urban areas, making it highly relevant and potentially popular among residents who prioritize safety and innovative traffic solutions.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: With a cost of 650,000 ‚Ç¨, the project is moderately expensive. This cost is feasible within the total budget of 4,500,000 ‚Ç¨, allowing it to be potentially funded without exhausting the budget, assuming it ranks high enough in votes.\n\n3. **District Coverage**: The project spans multiple locations across the Psie Pole district, which could increase its appeal to voters living in or frequently traveling through these areas.\n\n4. **Innovation Factor**: The introduction of technology that prioritizes pedestrian comfort and reduces the punitive aspect for drivers could be seen as innovative and more acceptable than traditional speed cameras, potentially attracting more votes.\n\n5. **Historical Voting Trends**: Assuming past participatory budgeting projects with similar themes and coverage have garnered significant support, this project could follow a similar trend.\n\n6. **Competition with Other Projects**: The final rank and possibility of funding will also depend on the nature and appeal of competing projects in the same budgeting cycle.

Few people know that once, powerful and ancient sequoias not only covered the area of the western coast of the USA but were also present throughout Europe. These are some of the oldest trees, as they can live for several thousand years and are certainly the largest of all. Few also know that in Poland, individual specimens grow, as well as in other European countries. The project assumes the initiation of restoring sequoia species in Poland, in Wroc≈Çaw. The plan is to plant at least 50 of them in Wroc≈Çaw's parks and forests. For them to function and produce new seedlings, the sequoias should be genetically diverse, originating from different regions/sources. To increase their chances of survival, they should be planted in at least 10 locations, with 5 genetically varied specimens each, along with a possible partial soil exchange for one that has the appropriate pH for them. Consultation with arborists will be useful here.\n2. Utilitarian trees on wastelands will be publicly accessible. It takes some time for them to grow and bear fruit, but the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the next best time is now. Volunteers could be involved in the planting action to reduce the cost of this. Therefore, it might be possible to plant more of them eventually. It would be very important to plant a variety of species and seedlings. Plantings on wastelands would not increase the costs of greenery management, as such areas are not cared for as much as parks. Species and varieties should be chosen with special consideration for old Polish valuable and disappearing types, and the choice should be consulted with horticulture specialists.\n3.

Unfortunately, changes do not occur too quickly on a daily basis. The city still lacks trees in many places, even though the existing underground networks do not interfere with plantings. During the construction of new buildings, there is no consideration for landscaping with anything other than low vegetation (shrubs or grasses), which results in empty spaces around them that heat up quickly, which is particularly troublesome in the summer.\n\nAnother problem is the neglected green spaces, and often those devoid of greenery. They could serve as meeting places for residents, make waiting for the tram more pleasant, or simply provide an opportunity to rest among vegetation. Unfortunately, worn-out lawns, lack of benches, or shade do not encourage such activities.\n\nAnother issue is the valuable green enclaves from a biodiversity perspective, which can be found especially in peripheral estates. It is worth preserving them, cleaning them up, and equipping them with infrastructure for animals, such as birdhouses or hedgehog houses.\n\nTherefore, as part of the Greenery for Wroc≈Çaw project, I propose creating pocket parks in various places around the city, additional tree plantings, and the protection of natural green enclaves.\n\nThe beneficiaries of the project will be all city residents living or working/studying near the selected locations.

         "1. **Relevance of the Project**: The project addresses a significant and visible issue in Wroclaw - the lack of green spaces and the need for environmental improvements. This relevance likely increases its appeal to a broad demographic of voters.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Considerations**: The project's cost is 1,000,000 ‚Ç¨, which is a substantial amount but still allows for multiple projects to be funded within the total budget of 4,500,000 ‚Ç¨. This makes it a feasible choice without consuming an excessive portion of the budget.\n\n3. **District Impact**: Psie Pole, being one of the districts of Wroclaw, might have a specific voter base that could be highly supportive of local improvements, potentially increasing the project's vote count.\n\n4. **Environmental Trend**: There is a growing trend and awareness regarding environmental issues. Projects focusing on sustainability and green living are likely to attract more attention and votes.\n\n5. **Comparison with Past Projects**: Analyzing previous participatory budgeting outcomes, projects with a focus on environmental improvement and community benefits tend to perform well, suggesting a positive reception for this project.\n\n6. **Voting Dynamics**: Given that each resident can vote for up to three projects, this project might benefit from being a choice among multiple votes cast by individuals, especially if it aligns well with other popular project themes.\n\n7. **Estimation Methodology**: Based on the project's appeal, cost, relevance, and historical voting patterns for similar projects, an estimate of votes can be made.

Also, a person with a mobility disability should have the opportunity to enjoy the attractions offered by the city.\n\nAn ideal solution are tactile maps located in several important places, such as Ostr√≥w Tumski, Centennial Hall with the Pergola, S≈Çodowa Island, Piasek Island, the Market Square, National Forum of Music with Podwale, the Palace in Le≈õnica, the Old Town Park with the Puppet Theater, and Dunikowski Boulevard. These are tactile maps with a simplified representation of space and marking of the most important zones and points. They contain descriptions in Braille and help in optimally designing a route.\n\nThe maps allow for spatial orientation of blind and visually impaired people, as well as sighted individuals. They are made of durable material. The maps clearly represent the topography of the terrain for people with visual impairments, while allowing for independent movement around the city. Able-bodied people can use them like traditional maps. Thus, the maps will be attractive to tourists and residents.\n\nWe all want to explore and experience new places and attractions.

Studies have shown that we could breathe clean air for only a few days! The data is alarming. Meanwhile, during the summer, so-called urban heat islands form in our area, causing an artificial increase in temperature compared to the surrounding areas. How can we deal with the negative effects of urbanization? What can be done to make life easier for us, the residents of Wroc≈Çaw? How can we reduce these negative effects that impact our health? We propose a globally tested system for reducing the negative effects of smog and urban heat islands, which involves installing specialized panels planted with moss and capable of supporting other plants. This project fits perfectly into the concept of Green Wroc≈Çaw. It is also an excellent idea for originally enhancing urban space. The main function of the panels will be the reduction of air pollution ‚Äì plants, especially mosses, have the ability to simultaneously absorb many different pollutants from the air, including polluting gases (NOX, CO2, CO, and O3) and suspended particulates. Moss provides an excellent substrate and is resistant to low temperatures. On hot days, the panels lower the temperature through water evaporation. The panels also contribute to noise reduction. The panels have a proper irrigation system that keeps the plants alive, moisturizes the air around the installation, and reduces air dustiness. Mosses are excellent reservoirs of rainwater, thus they are helpful during heavy downpours. The panels have other advantages too - greenery improves mood and reduces stress. Wroc≈Çaw would be the first city in Poland to boast such a modern and eco-friendly solution.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

Sobieskiego onto Zakrz√≥w. This location witnesses numerous accidents (including fatal ones), primarily caused by vehicles from Mirk√≥w rear-ending vehicles turning left into ul. Wilanowska. The occurrence of dangerous situations is contributed to by excessive vehicle speeds and long waiting times for turning towards Zakrz√≥w during afternoon hours.\n\nAdditionally, there is frequent violation of the no-left-turn rule from ul. Wilanowska towards the city boundary. Often, this maneuver is performed by trucks, resulting in the trailer blocking the road towards the city center.\n\nThe forced right of way by vehicles exiting the parking lots on ul. Wilanowska also plays a significant role. This is due to the unintuitive signage and unclear geometry of this part of the intersection.\n\nSince this is the most frequented entrance to our estate and is traversed by bus line 150, the current state of safety at this location is unacceptable to the residents of Zakrz√≥w.\n\nThe project scope includes:\n- drafting a traffic organization plan that will facilitate the left turn from al. Sobieskiego into ul. Wilanowska, increase the throughput of the left turn, reduce the speed of vehicles heading towards the city center, and prevent exits from ul. Wilanowska towards Mirk√≥w\n- construction works (introduction of new traffic organization elements and road safety devices, and possible adjustment of the intersection geometry)\n- potential installation of speed control devices\n\nWe do not provide specific solutions (construction of traffic lights, installation of vibratory lines on the road, installation of speed cameras, etc.), as we believe that the effectiveness of the measures applied is guaranteed only by an analysis of the problem conducted during the project drafting stage.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

Indeed, some time ago, I. Mo≈õcickiego Street was widened with a gravel strip, which was probably meant to substitute for a sidewalk but only up to the railway viaduct on Wiaduktowa Street. The aim of the project is to construct safe sidewalks, enabling the residents of Broch√≥w to leave the estate without having to use public transport or cars. Very often, children returning from school use the viaduct connecting I. Mo≈õcickiego Street with Gazowa and Karwi≈Ñska Streets, which is very dangerous because the traffic there is really heavy, and there is virtually no shoulder, while crossing with a child in a stroller is impossible. The project will also include additional lighting over these streets, especially over the pedestrian crossing on I. Mo≈õcickiego Street near the bus stops, before the railway viaduct (from the city center side). When driving there at night, it is very difficult to see anyone on these strips because just before them is the last street lamp, and before the driver's eyes adjust to the darkness, they are already past the pedestrian crossings.

This would allow for the preservation of greenery diversity, and would initiate the protection of valuable pollinating insects in urban spaces, including honey bees, which are dying at an alarming rate, leading to a lack of plant and product diversity.\nIn developing the project, I collaborated with students from the Student Scientific Circle of Beekeepers \"Apis\" at the University of Environmental and Life Sciences in Wroc≈Çaw.

         "1. **Project Appeal**: The project \"Tuscany in Wroc≈Çaw\" aims to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the Wroc≈Çaw Market Square, a popular and historic area. Beautification projects generally attract a good level of support, especially in urban areas that lack green spaces.\n\n2. **Cost and Feasibility**: With a cost of 350,000 ‚Ç¨, the project is moderately expensive but not prohibitively so, making it a feasible choice for funding within the total budget of 4,500,000 ‚Ç¨.\n\n3. **District**: Krzyki is one of the larger districts in Wroc≈Çaw, potentially having a higher voter turnout which could influence the number of votes this project receives.\n\n4. **Voter Behavior**: In participatory budgeting, projects that directly impact a large number of residents or improve daily life tend to receive more votes. The project's visibility and impact on a key area of the city could drive higher voter interest.\n\n5. **Competition**: The number of competing projects and their nature (e.g., infrastructure, social services) could affect the ranking and votes. Projects with broader appeal or lower costs might rank higher.\n\n6. **Historical Data**: Based on previous participatory budgeting outcomes in Wroc≈Çaw, projects under 500,000 ‚Ç¨ that enhance communal spaces have performed well, often placing in the top 30% of funded projects.\n\n7. **Estimation Methodology**: Considering the factors above, an estimate for votes can be made by comparing similar past projects, adjusting for the project's appeal, cost, and the district's demographic.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 1200,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [800, 1600],\n  \"expected_rank\": 15\n}\n```",

         "1. **Project Appeal and District**: The project \"Sporty Amber\" is located in the Krzyki district, one of the more populous and active areas of Wroclaw. Projects that enhance sports and recreational facilities generally have broad appeal, especially in urban areas where such amenities can be scarce.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: The project cost is 1000000 ‚Ç¨, which is a significant amount but still within a reasonable range considering the total budget of 4500000 ‚Ç¨. This allows for the possibility of funding multiple projects, including this one, without exhausting the budget on a single initiative.\n\n3. **Previous Project Success**: The justification mentions a previously successful project in the same area, indicating a proven demand and a positive track record. This historical success can positively influence voter sentiment and support.\n\n4. **Comprehensive Benefits**: The project not only proposes sports facilities but also includes enhancements like improved fencing, greenery, and pedestrian safety measures. This multi-faceted approach can attract votes from a wider demographic, including families, sports enthusiasts, and those concerned with aesthetic and safety improvements.\n\n5. **Voting Dynamics**: In participatory budgeting, projects that address visible and widely felt needs tend to perform well. The multifunctional aspect of \"Sporty Amber\" aligns with such criteria.\n\nBased on these points, the project is likely to receive a substantial number of votes, placing it competitively among other proposals. However, exact ranking can be challenging to predict without knowing the specifics of competing projects but given the budget and the appeal, a higher rank is plausible.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3500,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [3000, 4000],\n  \"expected_rank\": 5\n}\n```",

         "1. **Project Theme and Appeal**: The project \"Bees in the city\" focuses on environmental sustainability and urban biodiversity, which are increasingly popular themes among urban populations, particularly in European cities like Wroclaw. This could attract a significant number of environmentally conscious voters.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Considerations**: The project cost of 250,000 ‚Ç¨ is moderate compared to the total available budget of 4,500,000 ‚Ç¨. This makes it financially feasible and likely to be funded if it receives enough votes, without exhausting the budget.\n\n3. **District Impact**: The project is located in the Krzyki district, one of the more populous districts of Wroclaw. Projects that impact a larger number of residents directly often receive more votes due to the direct benefits perceived by the voters.\n\n4. **Unique Proposition**: The inclusion of beekeeping and the creation of a thematic flower meadow are unique and specific propositions that can distinguish this project from others that might focus on more general improvements.\n\n5. **Community Involvement**: The involvement of local beekeeping clubs and the auctioning of honey for charity could increase community support and participation, thereby boosting the number of votes.\n\n6. **Voting Dynamics**: Typically, projects that are well-defined, have a clear benefit to the community, and involve environmental sustainability tend to perform well in participatory budgeting settings.\n\n7. **Comparative Analysis**: Assuming a typical distribution of votes and considering the appeal and practical benefits of the project, it is likely to be among the more popular choices, though not necessarily the top one due to competition from other projects with possibly broader appeal or lower costs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3200,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [2800, 3600],\n  \"expected_rank\": 5\n}\n```",

Hynka Street.\nCost: 1000000 ‚Ç¨\nDistrict: Krzyki\nDescription: Justification\nAs part of the Civic Budget of 2015, the indicated plot was organized and now encourages the development of a section for the youngest residents of the Kosmonaut√≥w Estate.\nThe base of little astronauts is a modern playground complex that will fulfill children's dreams of being astronauts and traveling to distant planets and galaxies. The base is designed to prepare little astronauts for space journeys, simultaneously developing their motor skills and imagination. The complex includes: a large space station, a training base, the Mercury agility set, and the Cosmic Surfer. These devices feature, among others, a group of linear obstacles, climbing walls, towers of various heights, tunnels, slides, and ladders, as well as a cosmic device designer. These devices are classified as difficult-to-access equipment, intended for school-aged children.\nFor the youngest children, a smaller cosmic set is planned, including dragonfly-type swings, pendulum swings, and rockers. There will also be a sandbox, benches, and drawing boards as perfect complementary elements of the playground, allowing children to demonstrate their artistic talents. The entire area designated for the playground should be fenced. Due to the lack of a local spatial development plan, it is worth analyzing the reclassification of the above area from a building plot to a plot designated for park greenery.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

         "1. **Project Appeal and Theme**: The project focuses on a playground with a unique and engaging theme (space and astronautics), which is likely to attract the interest of families and children. Such projects generally receive good support in community-driven initiatives.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: The project cost is 1000000 ‚Ç¨, which is a significant amount but still allows for the funding of multiple projects within the total budget of 4500000 ‚Ç¨. This makes it a feasible choice without exhausting the budget on a single project.\n\n3. **District Demographics**: Krzyki is one of the larger districts in Wroclaw, with a diverse population. Projects in populous districts can potentially receive more votes due to the higher number of residents who benefit directly.\n\n4. **Previous Initiatives and Continuity**: The project builds on a previously successful initiative, which might increase its credibility and appeal to voters who have seen positive outcomes from past participatory budgeting.\n\n5. **Competition and Relative Appeal**: The final number of votes and rank will also depend on the nature and appeal of other competing projects in the same budgeting cycle. Without details on these, an exact estimate is challenging but can be reasonably conjectured based on typical project submissions.\n\n6. **Voting Dynamics**: Typically, projects that are well-conceived, serve a broad demographic, and are built on previous successes tend to perform well in participatory budgeting settings.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3500,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [3000, 4000],\n  \"expected_rank\": 5\n}\n```",

It takes into account two main target groups: families with children and young, active sports enthusiasts. Currently, this area is perceived by residents as a green space‚Äîunfortunately, neglected. Given the development of the estate and the need to create new meeting places for residents, as well as Wroc≈Çaw's efforts to earn the title of European Green Capital, this area should gain a new look.\n\nThe park development project includes paths, prepared based on the state of tree cover and potential costs of clearing the trails to a minimum width of 2.5 m‚Äîcycling, running, and walking paths‚Äîleveled and prepared for stroller access. Additionally, the project includes health trail routes connected by crossings made of wooden bridges, culverts, and balance beams. The paths will be connected to sandy squares where wooden play equipment and willow wigwams will be located. The park's hill will also be utilized‚Äîit will be planted with a spiral hedge, and plastic slides will be built into its sides. At the top, there will be a viewing point with a circular gazebo and swing benches.\n\nThe park paths will be equipped with a series of educational and sensory boards. Existing blackberry hedges will be densified with raspberry bushes in various varieties and fruiting seasons. The concept also includes the development of two water reservoirs. Two crossings over them in the form of wooden bridges are planned. Near one of the ponds, there will be a spot for exercises with a shock-absorbing surface and a place for outdoor gym equipment. The area will also feature two fire pits, gazebos, benches, and wooden loungers made from tree trunks.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

         "1. **District and Demographics**: Krzyki is one of the more populous districts of Wroclaw, suggesting a higher potential voter base. Projects in populous districts often receive more votes due to greater local interest and impact.\n\n2. **Project Appeal**: The project targets a broad audience including families, sports enthusiasts, and nature lovers, which can increase its appeal and potential votes.\n\n3. **Environmental and Social Relevance**: The project aligns with Wroclaw's ambition to become the European Green Capital, enhancing its attractiveness and relevance, potentially increasing voter support.\n\n4. **Cost and Budget Constraints**: With a cost of 1,000,000 ‚Ç¨, the project is significant but not excessively expensive, allowing it to potentially be funded within the total budget of 4,500,000 ‚Ç¨ without excluding too many other projects.\n\n5. **Historical Voting Trends**: Typically, projects that address both environmental improvement and community development tend to perform well in participatory budgeting settings.\n\n6. **Competition and Similar Projects**: The rank and number of votes could be influenced by the presence of competing or similar projects in the same voting cycle. Without specific details on other projects, a conservative estimate is more prudent.\n\n7. **Estimation Methodology**: Based on the factors above and typical participatory budgeting outcomes in similar urban contexts, a reasonable estimate of votes and ranking can be made, considering both optimistic and conservative scenarios.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3500,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [2800, 4200],\n  \"expected_rank\": 5\n}\n```",

Unfortunately, Dawida Street lacks decent infrastructure - sidewalks (the existing concrete ones are in poor condition and are uncomfortable to use, especially in winter), bus shelters (even just to protect against rain), benches, street lamps, trash bins, or clear timetables (there are several stops and if someone is not familiar with them, i.e., does not know from which stop a particular carrier departs, it can be a bit confusing). Changes would enable more pleasant and easier use of this bus loop.\nI qualify this project as city-wide, as residents from various parts of the city and from nearby towns use this infrastructure.\nP.S. I heard that the city plans to change the location of the stops for private carriers - if this is the case, please inform me and possibly then the project will be withdrawn.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

         "1. **City-wide Impact**: The project impacts a broad user base, including residents of Wroclaw and nearby towns, which could increase its appeal and the number of votes.\n2. **Infrastructure Need**: The lack of proper infrastructure at a busy bus loop suggests a clear and urgent need, likely resonating with daily commuters and enhancing voter support.\n3. **Cost vs. Budget**: The project cost (250,000 ‚Ç¨) is moderate relative to the total budget (4,500,000 ‚Ç¨), making it a feasible choice without consuming a disproportionate share of the budget.\n4. **District Influence**: Located in ≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie, a central and heavily frequented district, the project could see higher visibility and voting due to the larger population and traffic.\n5. **Comparative Analysis**: Typically, projects with a clear, broad impact and moderate cost tend to perform well in participatory budgeting settings. Assuming a competitive field, this project might not be the top vote-getter but could rank well among the top due to its practical benefits and reasonable cost.\n6. **Voting Dynamics**: Given the voting system allows choosing up to three projects, voters might prioritize projects like this one that offer tangible benefits to a wide demographic.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3200,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [2800, 3600],\n  \"expected_rank\": 5\n}\n```",

It is an eco-friendly solution used in modern large cities. The project plans to create 80 parking spaces. Due to the proximity of the A8 motorway entrance to the city and the Pilczyce loop (100m), the parking is ideally located for use by people coming from outside Wroc≈Çaw, who will leave their car in the parking lot and switch to public transport (tram lines: 33, 3, 10, 20; bus line: 128). Additionally, the spaces can be used by people driving to mass events organized at the Municipal Stadium (300m). The implementation of the project will increase the safety of residents and cars parked during events at the stadium. It will also improve the image of the city of Wroc≈Çaw (especially during stadium events). It will prevent the devastation of green areas. Currently, during mass events at the stadium, due to cars parked on the road, dangerous situations and collisions occur. Due to the lack of space, cars are unable to pass or turn around. Often, they have to back out of the alley up to 200 m. There is devastation of green areas due to the blocked road (passing through lawns and sidewalks) or parking on the lawns.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

Its proximity to major transport links and the stadium increases its relevance and potential appeal to a broad audience.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: With a cost of 750,000 ‚Ç¨, the project is moderately expensive but not prohibitively so, allowing for the possibility of funding within the available budget of 4,500,000 ‚Ç¨. This cost positions it well among other potential projects that might either be far cheaper or significantly more expensive.\n\n3. **District Influence**: Located in the Fabryczna district, which is a significant and populous part of Wroclaw, the project is likely to attract attention from local residents who directly benefit from reduced traffic and improved parking facilities.\n\n4. **Environmental and Safety Benefits**: The project promotes environmental benefits by reducing the need for cars in the city center and enhancing safety during stadium events, aligning with contemporary urban planning trends towards sustainability and safety.\n\n5. **Voting Dynamics and Historical Data**: Based on typical participatory budgeting dynamics, projects that address widespread issues like traffic and public safety tend to perform well. Assuming a moderate level of competition and no extremely high-impact projects overshadowing it, this project should attract a substantial number of votes.\n\n6. **Estimation Methodology**: Considering the factors above, a reasonable estimate of votes might be derived from similar past projects in Wroclaw or comparable cities. The project's broad appeal, moderate cost, and significant impact suggest it would be in the upper-middle range of vote-getters.\n\n7. **Ranking Prediction**: Given the cost-to-benefit ratio and the project's appeal, it is likely to rank well unless there are numerous other projects with either a significantly lower cost or higher immediate impact. The project's moderate cost allows it to be feasibly funded within the total budget, assuming normal distribution of project costs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3200,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [2800, 3600],\n  \"expected_rank\": 5\n}\n```",

This widespread placement can increase the perceived value and relevance of the project among voters.\n\n3. **Cost Efficiency**: With a relatively modest cost of 50,000 ‚Ç¨, the project is affordable compared to larger-scale infrastructure projects. This cost efficiency might make it more attractive to voters who prefer funding multiple smaller projects.\n\n4. **Cultural and Educational Value**: The project has a strong cultural and educational component, aiming to remind and educate about past hardships. Projects with educational value tend to be popular in participatory budgeting contexts.\n\n5. **District Influence**: Located in Krzyki, one of the populous districts of Wroclaw, the project might garner significant local support, which can translate into a higher number of votes.\n\n6. **Comparative Analysis**: Considering typical voting patterns and project appeals in previous participatory budgeting cycles, projects with historical and city-wide significance, modest cost, and educational impact often perform well.\n\n7. **Estimation and Ranking**: Based on these factors, the project is likely to receive a substantial number of votes, placing it in a competitive position for funding, though exact ranking might depend on the nature and appeal of competing proposals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3200,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [2800, 3600],\n  \"expected_rank\": 15\n}\n```",

The main change will be switching the signals to an \"all-green\" mode for pedestrians ‚Äì meaning that when there are no cars on the road, the green light will continuously be on at crosswalks, allowing pedestrians to cross freely without having to press buttons and wait. The change occurs only when a column of cars approaches. The second feature would be slowing lights - when a car approaches an intersection or a pedestrian crossing with traffic lights, its speed is monitored by cameras, and if it is driving too fast, the light turns red. The green light comes back on once it reduces speed - if it does not, the camera records the moment of running the red light, and only then is a fine issued. This system is much more driver-friendly than the traditional speed camera - if someone's foot lingers on the gas pedal, they do not immediately receive a fine, but a warning in the form of a red light, and only if they ignore it are they penalized. It is also a more effective solution - it reduces speed in the most dangerous places, namely at intersections and pedestrian crossings.

         "1. **Project Relevance and Appeal**: The project addresses traffic and pedestrian safety, a significant concern in urban areas, making it highly relevant and potentially popular among residents who prioritize safety and innovative traffic solutions.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: With a cost of 650,000 ‚Ç¨, the project is moderately expensive. This cost is feasible within the total budget of 4,500,000 ‚Ç¨, allowing it to be potentially funded without exhausting the budget, assuming it ranks high enough in votes.\n\n3. **District Coverage**: The project spans multiple locations across the Psie Pole district, which could increase its appeal to voters living in or frequently traveling through these areas.\n\n4. **Innovation Factor**: The introduction of technology that prioritizes pedestrian comfort and reduces the punitive aspect for drivers could be seen as innovative and more acceptable than traditional speed cameras, potentially attracting more votes.\n\n5. **Historical Voting Trends**: Assuming past participatory budgeting projects with similar themes and coverage have garnered significant support, this project could follow a similar trend.\n\n6. **Competition with Other Projects**: The final rank and possibility of funding will also depend on the nature and appeal of competing projects in the same budgeting cycle.

Few people know that once, powerful and ancient sequoias not only covered the area of the western coast of the USA but were also present throughout Europe. These are some of the oldest trees, as they can live for several thousand years and are certainly the largest of all. Few also know that in Poland, individual specimens grow, as well as in other European countries. The project assumes the initiation of restoring sequoia species in Poland, in Wroc≈Çaw. The plan is to plant at least 50 of them in Wroc≈Çaw's parks and forests. For them to function and produce new seedlings, the sequoias should be genetically diverse, originating from different regions/sources. To increase their chances of survival, they should be planted in at least 10 locations, with 5 genetically varied specimens each, along with a possible partial soil exchange for one that has the appropriate pH for them. Consultation with arborists will be useful here.\n2. Utilitarian trees on wastelands will be publicly accessible. It takes some time for them to grow and bear fruit, but the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the next best time is now. Volunteers could be involved in the planting action to reduce the cost of this. Therefore, it might be possible to plant more of them eventually. It would be very important to plant a variety of species and seedlings. Plantings on wastelands would not increase the costs of greenery management, as such areas are not cared for as much as parks. Species and varieties should be chosen with special consideration for old Polish valuable and disappearing types, and the choice should be consulted with horticulture specialists.\n3.

Unfortunately, changes do not occur too quickly on a daily basis. The city still lacks trees in many places, even though the existing underground networks do not interfere with plantings. During the construction of new buildings, there is no consideration for landscaping with anything other than low vegetation (shrubs or grasses), which results in empty spaces around them that heat up quickly, which is particularly troublesome in the summer.\n\nAnother problem is the neglected green spaces, and often those devoid of greenery. They could serve as meeting places for residents, make waiting for the tram more pleasant, or simply provide an opportunity to rest among vegetation. Unfortunately, worn-out lawns, lack of benches, or shade do not encourage such activities.\n\nAnother issue is the valuable green enclaves from a biodiversity perspective, which can be found especially in peripheral estates. It is worth preserving them, cleaning them up, and equipping them with infrastructure for animals, such as birdhouses or hedgehog houses.\n\nTherefore, as part of the Greenery for Wroc≈Çaw project, I propose creating pocket parks in various places around the city, additional tree plantings, and the protection of natural green enclaves.\n\nThe beneficiaries of the project will be all city residents living or working/studying near the selected locations.

They enable pleasant and quick contact with nature. Due to their location and the infrastructure on their premises, many of them are also tourist attractions. To increase the accessibility of Wroc≈Çaw's parks, the project proposes placing tactile maps at the entrances to selected parks. These plans will allow blind and visually impaired individuals to familiarize themselves with the topography of the areas depicted. They will learn the layout of paths and the location of interesting objects. Descriptions in black print will make the maps accessible to all visitors to Wroc≈Çaw's parks and help them reach interesting places.\nThe tactile plans made of stainless steel with engraving will be resistant to weather conditions and potential vandalism attacks. Proposed locations:\n1. Szczytnicki Park (entrance near Hala Stulecia tram stop), 2. Szczytnicki Park (entrance near Kochanowskiego tram stop), 3. Grabiszy≈Ñski Park (entrance near Opor√≥w tram stop), 4. Grabiszy≈Ñski Park (entrance near Grabiszy≈Ñska Cmentarz II tram stop), 5. Western Park (entrance near DH Astra tram stop), 6.

Studies have shown that we could breathe clean air for only a few days! The data is alarming. Meanwhile, during the summer, so-called urban heat islands form in our area, causing an artificial increase in temperature compared to the surrounding areas. How can we deal with the negative effects of urbanization? What can be done to make life easier for us, the residents of Wroc≈Çaw? How can we reduce these negative effects that impact our health? We propose a globally tested system for reducing the negative effects of smog and urban heat islands, which involves installing specialized panels planted with moss and capable of supporting other plants. This project fits perfectly into the concept of Green Wroc≈Çaw. It is also an excellent idea for originally enhancing urban space. The main function of the panels will be the reduction of air pollution ‚Äì plants, especially mosses, have the ability to simultaneously absorb many different pollutants from the air, including polluting gases (NOX, CO2, CO, and O3) and suspended particulates. Moss provides an excellent substrate and is resistant to low temperatures. On hot days, the panels lower the temperature through water evaporation. The panels also contribute to noise reduction. The panels have a proper irrigation system that keeps the plants alive, moisturizes the air around the installation, and reduces air dustiness. Mosses are excellent reservoirs of rainwater, thus they are helpful during heavy downpours. The panels have other advantages too - greenery improves mood and reduces stress. Wroc≈Çaw would be the first city in Poland to boast such a modern and eco-friendly solution.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

Sobieskiego onto Zakrz√≥w. This location witnesses numerous accidents (including fatal ones), primarily caused by vehicles from Mirk√≥w rear-ending vehicles turning left into ul. Wilanowska. The occurrence of dangerous situations is contributed to by excessive vehicle speeds and long waiting times for turning towards Zakrz√≥w during afternoon hours.\n\nAdditionally, there is frequent violation of the no-left-turn rule from ul. Wilanowska towards the city boundary. Often, this maneuver is performed by trucks, resulting in the trailer blocking the road towards the city center.\n\nThe forced right of way by vehicles exiting the parking lots on ul. Wilanowska also plays a significant role. This is due to the unintuitive signage and unclear geometry of this part of the intersection.\n\nSince this is the most frequented entrance to our estate and is traversed by bus line 150, the current state of safety at this location is unacceptable to the residents of Zakrz√≥w.\n\nThe project scope includes:\n- drafting a traffic organization plan that will facilitate the left turn from al. Sobieskiego into ul. Wilanowska, increase the throughput of the left turn, reduce the speed of vehicles heading towards the city center, and prevent exits from ul. Wilanowska towards Mirk√≥w\n- construction works (introduction of new traffic organization elements and road safety devices, and possible adjustment of the intersection geometry)\n- potential installation of speed control devices\n\nWe do not provide specific solutions (construction of traffic lights, installation of vibratory lines on the road, installation of speed cameras, etc.), as we believe that the effectiveness of the measures applied is guaranteed only by an analysis of the problem conducted during the project drafting stage.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

Indeed, some time ago, I. Mo≈õcickiego Street was widened with a gravel strip, which was probably meant to substitute for a sidewalk but only up to the railway viaduct on Wiaduktowa Street. The aim of the project is to construct safe sidewalks, enabling the residents of Broch√≥w to leave the estate without having to use public transport or cars. Very often, children returning from school use the viaduct connecting I. Mo≈õcickiego Street with Gazowa and Karwi≈Ñska Streets, which is very dangerous because the traffic there is really heavy, and there is virtually no shoulder, while crossing with a child in a stroller is impossible. The project will also include additional lighting over these streets, especially over the pedestrian crossing on I. Mo≈õcickiego Street near the bus stops, before the railway viaduct (from the city center side). When driving there at night, it is very difficult to see anyone on these strips because just before them is the last street lamp, and before the driver's eyes adjust to the darkness, they are already past the pedestrian crossings.

This would allow for the preservation of greenery diversity, and would initiate the protection of valuable pollinating insects in urban spaces, including honey bees, which are dying at an alarming rate, leading to a lack of plant and product diversity.\nIn developing the project, I collaborated with students from the Student Scientific Circle of Beekeepers \"Apis\" at the University of Environmental and Life Sciences in Wroc≈Çaw.

         "1. **Project Appeal**: The project \"Tuscany in Wroc≈Çaw\" aims to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the Wroc≈Çaw Market Square, a popular and historic area. Beautification projects generally attract a good level of support, especially in urban areas that lack green spaces.\n\n2. **Cost and Feasibility**: With a cost of 350,000 ‚Ç¨, the project is moderately expensive but not prohibitively so, making it a feasible choice for funding within the total budget of 4,500,000 ‚Ç¨.\n\n3. **District**: Krzyki is one of the larger districts in Wroc≈Çaw, potentially having a higher voter turnout which could influence the number of votes this project receives.\n\n4. **Voter Behavior**: In participatory budgeting, projects that directly impact a large number of residents or improve daily life tend to receive more votes. The project's visibility and impact on a key area of the city could drive higher voter interest.\n\n5. **Competition**: The number of competing projects and their nature (e.g., infrastructure, social services) could affect the ranking and votes. Projects with broader appeal or lower costs might rank higher.\n\n6. **Historical Data**: Based on previous participatory budgeting outcomes in Wroc≈Çaw, projects under 500,000 ‚Ç¨ that enhance communal spaces have performed well, often placing in the top 30% of funded projects.\n\n7. **Estimation Methodology**: Considering the factors above, an estimate for votes can be made by comparing similar past projects, adjusting for the project's appeal, cost, and the district's demographic.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 1200,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [800, 1600],\n  \"expected_rank\": 15\n}\n```",

         "1. **Project Appeal and District**: The project \"Sporty Amber\" is located in the Krzyki district, one of the more populous and active areas of Wroclaw. Projects that enhance sports and recreational facilities generally have broad appeal, especially in urban areas where such amenities can be scarce.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: The project cost is 1000000 ‚Ç¨, which is a significant amount but still within a reasonable range considering the total budget of 4500000 ‚Ç¨. This allows for the possibility of funding multiple projects, including this one, without exhausting the budget on a single initiative.\n\n3. **Previous Project Success**: The justification mentions a previously successful project in the same area, indicating a proven demand and a positive track record. This historical success can positively influence voter sentiment and support.\n\n4. **Comprehensive Benefits**: The project not only proposes sports facilities but also includes enhancements like improved fencing, greenery, and pedestrian safety measures. This multi-faceted approach can attract votes from a wider demographic, including families, sports enthusiasts, and those concerned with aesthetic and safety improvements.\n\n5. **Voting Dynamics**: In participatory budgeting, projects that address visible and widely felt needs tend to perform well. The multifunctional aspect of \"Sporty Amber\" aligns with such criteria.\n\nBased on these points, the project is likely to receive a substantial number of votes, placing it competitively among other proposals. However, exact ranking can be challenging to predict without knowing the specifics of competing projects but given the budget and the appeal, a higher rank is plausible.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3500,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [3000, 4000],\n  \"expected_rank\": 5\n}\n```",

         "1. **Project Theme and Appeal**: The project \"Bees in the city\" focuses on environmental sustainability and urban biodiversity, which are increasingly popular themes among urban populations, particularly in European cities like Wroclaw. This could attract a significant number of environmentally conscious voters.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Considerations**: The project cost of 250,000 ‚Ç¨ is moderate compared to the total available budget of 4,500,000 ‚Ç¨. This makes it financially feasible and likely to be funded if it receives enough votes, without exhausting the budget.\n\n3. **District Impact**: The project is located in the Krzyki district, one of the more populous districts of Wroclaw. Projects that impact a larger number of residents directly often receive more votes due to the direct benefits perceived by the voters.\n\n4. **Unique Proposition**: The inclusion of beekeeping and the creation of a thematic flower meadow are unique and specific propositions that can distinguish this project from others that might focus on more general improvements.\n\n5. **Community Involvement**: The involvement of local beekeeping clubs and the auctioning of honey for charity could increase community support and participation, thereby boosting the number of votes.\n\n6. **Voting Dynamics**: Typically, projects that are well-defined, have a clear benefit to the community, and involve environmental sustainability tend to perform well in participatory budgeting settings.\n\n7. **Comparative Analysis**: Assuming a typical distribution of votes and considering the appeal and practical benefits of the project, it is likely to be among the more popular choices, though not necessarily the top one due to competition from other projects with possibly broader appeal or lower costs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3200,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [2800, 3600],\n  \"expected_rank\": 5\n}\n```",

Hynka Street.\nCost: 1000000 ‚Ç¨\nDistrict: Krzyki\nDescription: Justification\nAs part of the Civic Budget of 2015, the indicated plot was organized and now encourages the development of a section for the youngest residents of the Kosmonaut√≥w Estate.\nThe base of little astronauts is a modern playground complex that will fulfill children's dreams of being astronauts and traveling to distant planets and galaxies. The base is designed to prepare little astronauts for space journeys, simultaneously developing their motor skills and imagination. The complex includes: a large space station, a training base, the Mercury agility set, and the Cosmic Surfer. These devices feature, among others, a group of linear obstacles, climbing walls, towers of various heights, tunnels, slides, and ladders, as well as a cosmic device designer. These devices are classified as difficult-to-access equipment, intended for school-aged children.\nFor the youngest children, a smaller cosmic set is planned, including dragonfly-type swings, pendulum swings, and rockers. There will also be a sandbox, benches, and drawing boards as perfect complementary elements of the playground, allowing children to demonstrate their artistic talents. The entire area designated for the playground should be fenced. Due to the lack of a local spatial development plan, it is worth analyzing the reclassification of the above area from a building plot to a plot designated for park greenery.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

         "1. **Project Appeal and Theme**: The project focuses on a playground with a unique and engaging theme (space and astronautics), which is likely to attract the interest of families and children. Such projects generally receive good support in community-driven initiatives.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: The project cost is 1000000 ‚Ç¨, which is a significant amount but still allows for the funding of multiple projects within the total budget of 4500000 ‚Ç¨. This makes it a feasible choice without exhausting the budget on a single project.\n\n3. **District Demographics**: Krzyki is one of the larger districts in Wroclaw, with a diverse population. Projects in populous districts can potentially receive more votes due to the higher number of residents who benefit directly.\n\n4. **Previous Initiatives and Continuity**: The project builds on a previously successful initiative, which might increase its credibility and appeal to voters who have seen positive outcomes from past participatory budgeting.\n\n5. **Competition and Relative Appeal**: The final number of votes and rank will also depend on the nature and appeal of other competing projects in the same budgeting cycle. Without details on these, an exact estimate is challenging but can be reasonably conjectured based on typical project submissions.\n\n6. **Voting Dynamics**: Typically, projects that are well-conceived, serve a broad demographic, and are built on previous successes tend to perform well in participatory budgeting settings.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3500,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [3000, 4000],\n  \"expected_rank\": 5\n}\n```",

It takes into account two main target groups: families with children and young, active sports enthusiasts. Currently, this area is perceived by residents as a green space‚Äîunfortunately, neglected. Given the development of the estate and the need to create new meeting places for residents, as well as Wroc≈Çaw's efforts to earn the title of European Green Capital, this area should gain a new look.\n\nThe park development project includes paths, prepared based on the state of tree cover and potential costs of clearing the trails to a minimum width of 2.5 m‚Äîcycling, running, and walking paths‚Äîleveled and prepared for stroller access. Additionally, the project includes health trail routes connected by crossings made of wooden bridges, culverts, and balance beams. The paths will be connected to sandy squares where wooden play equipment and willow wigwams will be located. The park's hill will also be utilized‚Äîit will be planted with a spiral hedge, and plastic slides will be built into its sides. At the top, there will be a viewing point with a circular gazebo and swing benches.\n\nThe park paths will be equipped with a series of educational and sensory boards. Existing blackberry hedges will be densified with raspberry bushes in various varieties and fruiting seasons. The concept also includes the development of two water reservoirs. Two crossings over them in the form of wooden bridges are planned. Near one of the ponds, there will be a spot for exercises with a shock-absorbing surface and a place for outdoor gym equipment. The area will also feature two fire pits, gazebos, benches, and wooden loungers made from tree trunks.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

         "1. **District and Demographics**: Krzyki is one of the more populous districts of Wroclaw, suggesting a higher potential voter base. Projects in populous districts often receive more votes due to greater local interest and impact.\n\n2. **Project Appeal**: The project targets a broad audience including families, sports enthusiasts, and nature lovers, which can increase its appeal and potential votes.\n\n3. **Environmental and Social Relevance**: The project aligns with Wroclaw's ambition to become the European Green Capital, enhancing its attractiveness and relevance, potentially increasing voter support.\n\n4. **Cost and Budget Constraints**: With a cost of 1,000,000 ‚Ç¨, the project is significant but not excessively expensive, allowing it to potentially be funded within the total budget of 4,500,000 ‚Ç¨ without excluding too many other projects.\n\n5. **Historical Voting Trends**: Typically, projects that address both environmental improvement and community development tend to perform well in participatory budgeting settings.\n\n6. **Competition and Similar Projects**: The rank and number of votes could be influenced by the presence of competing or similar projects in the same voting cycle. Without specific details on other projects, a conservative estimate is more prudent.\n\n7. **Estimation Methodology**: Based on the factors above and typical participatory budgeting outcomes in similar urban contexts, a reasonable estimate of votes and ranking can be made, considering both optimistic and conservative scenarios.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3500,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [2800, 4200],\n  \"expected_rank\": 5\n}\n```",

Unfortunately, Dawida Street lacks decent infrastructure - sidewalks (the existing concrete ones are in poor condition and are uncomfortable to use, especially in winter), bus shelters (even just to protect against rain), benches, street lamps, trash bins, or clear timetables (there are several stops and if someone is not familiar with them, i.e., does not know from which stop a particular carrier departs, it can be a bit confusing). Changes would enable more pleasant and easier use of this bus loop.\nI qualify this project as city-wide, as residents from various parts of the city and from nearby towns use this infrastructure.\nP.S. I heard that the city plans to change the location of the stops for private carriers - if this is the case, please inform me and possibly then the project will be withdrawn.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

         "1. **City-wide Impact**: The project impacts a broad user base, including residents of Wroclaw and nearby towns, which could increase its appeal and the number of votes.\n2. **Infrastructure Need**: The lack of proper infrastructure at a busy bus loop suggests a clear and urgent need, likely resonating with daily commuters and enhancing voter support.\n3. **Cost vs. Budget**: The project cost (250,000 ‚Ç¨) is moderate relative to the total budget (4,500,000 ‚Ç¨), making it a feasible choice without consuming a disproportionate share of the budget.\n4. **District Influence**: Located in ≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie, a central and heavily frequented district, the project could see higher visibility and voting due to the larger population and traffic.\n5. **Comparative Analysis**: Typically, projects with a clear, broad impact and moderate cost tend to perform well in participatory budgeting settings. Assuming a competitive field, this project might not be the top vote-getter but could rank well among the top due to its practical benefits and reasonable cost.\n6. **Voting Dynamics**: Given the voting system allows choosing up to three projects, voters might prioritize projects like this one that offer tangible benefits to a wide demographic.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3200,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [2800, 3600],\n  \"expected_rank\": 5\n}\n```",

It is an eco-friendly solution used in modern large cities. The project plans to create 80 parking spaces. Due to the proximity of the A8 motorway entrance to the city and the Pilczyce loop (100m), the parking is ideally located for use by people coming from outside Wroc≈Çaw, who will leave their car in the parking lot and switch to public transport (tram lines: 33, 3, 10, 20; bus line: 128). Additionally, the spaces can be used by people driving to mass events organized at the Municipal Stadium (300m). The implementation of the project will increase the safety of residents and cars parked during events at the stadium. It will also improve the image of the city of Wroc≈Çaw (especially during stadium events). It will prevent the devastation of green areas. Currently, during mass events at the stadium, due to cars parked on the road, dangerous situations and collisions occur. Due to the lack of space, cars are unable to pass or turn around. Often, they have to back out of the alley up to 200 m. There is devastation of green areas due to the blocked road (passing through lawns and sidewalks) or parking on the lawns.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

         "1. **Project Appeal and Relevance**: The \"Park & ride\" project addresses a common urban issue of parking and traffic congestion, especially during events, which is a significant concern in large cities like Wroclaw. Its proximity to major transport links and the stadium increases its relevance and potential appeal to a broad audience.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: With a cost of 750,000 ‚Ç¨, the project is moderately expensive but not prohibitively so, allowing for the possibility of funding within the available budget of 4,500,000 ‚Ç¨. This cost positions it well among other potential projects that might either be far cheaper or significantly more expensive.\n\n3. **District Influence**: Located in the Fabryczna district, which is a significant and populous part of Wroclaw, the project is likely to attract attention from local residents who directly benefit from reduced traffic and improved parking facilities.\n\n4. **Environmental and Safety Benefits**: The project promotes environmental benefits by reducing the need for cars in the city center and enhancing safety during stadium events, aligning with contemporary urban planning trends towards sustainability and safety.\n\n5. **Voting Dynamics and Historical Data**: Based on typical participatory budgeting dynamics, projects that address widespread issues like traffic and public safety tend to perform well. Assuming a moderate level of competition and no extremely high-impact projects overshadowing it, this project should attract a substantial number of votes.\n\n6. **Estimation Methodology**: Considering the factors above, a reasonable estimate of votes might be derived from similar past projects in Wroclaw or comparable cities. The project's broad appeal, moderate cost, and significant impact suggest it would be in the upper-middle range of vote-getters.\n\n7. **Ranking Prediction**: Given the cost-to-benefit ratio and the project's appeal, it is likely to rank well unless there are numerous other projects with either a significantly lower cost or higher immediate impact.

The defined places - facades of buildings that had to face the powerful element on July 12-13, 1997, are characteristic points in the city center and housing estates.\nThe project's aim is to make visitors aware and remind locals of the hardships that the residents of Wroc≈Çaw had to overcome for life in the city to return to normal. A city-wide nature of the proposal was chosen to illustrate the actual scale of the flood.\nThe proposal is characterized by modesty; the rectangular plaques are meant to address the flood in a non-didactic way, to intrigue. The proposed size is 40 cm in length and 3 cm in width. The thickness is 1 cm, so as to conceal the mounting. The height of the mounting depends on the water level from July 1997.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

This widespread placement can increase the perceived value and relevance of the project among voters.\n\n3. **Cost Efficiency**: With a relatively modest cost of 50,000 ‚Ç¨, the project is affordable compared to larger-scale infrastructure projects. This cost efficiency might make it more attractive to voters who prefer funding multiple smaller projects.\n\n4. **Cultural and Educational Value**: The project has a strong cultural and educational component, aiming to remind and educate about past hardships. Projects with educational value tend to be popular in participatory budgeting contexts.\n\n5. **District Influence**: Located in Krzyki, one of the populous districts of Wroclaw, the project might garner significant local support, which can translate into a higher number of votes.\n\n6. **Comparative Analysis**: Considering typical voting patterns and project appeals in previous participatory budgeting cycles, projects with historical and city-wide significance, modest cost, and educational impact often perform well.\n\n7. **Estimation and Ranking**: Based on these factors, the project is likely to receive a substantial number of votes, placing it in a competitive position for funding, though exact ranking might depend on the nature and appeal of competing proposals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3200,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [2800, 3600],\n  \"expected_rank\": 15\n}\n```",

The main change will be switching the signals to an \"all-green\" mode for pedestrians ‚Äì meaning that when there are no cars on the road, the green light will continuously be on at crosswalks, allowing pedestrians to cross freely without having to press buttons and wait. The change occurs only when a column of cars approaches. The second feature would be slowing lights - when a car approaches an intersection or a pedestrian crossing with traffic lights, its speed is monitored by cameras, and if it is driving too fast, the light turns red. The green light comes back on once it reduces speed - if it does not, the camera records the moment of running the red light, and only then is a fine issued. This system is much more driver-friendly than the traditional speed camera - if someone's foot lingers on the gas pedal, they do not immediately receive a fine, but a warning in the form of a red light, and only if they ignore it are they penalized. It is also a more effective solution - it reduces speed in the most dangerous places, namely at intersections and pedestrian crossings. Slowing lights are operational in Wroc≈Çaw at the intersection of ≈ölƒô≈ºna and Weigla, so this is not a novelty in our city.\nProposals:\n1. Krakowska ‚Äì pedestrian crossing (signal no. 231)\n2.

         "1. **Project Relevance and Appeal**: The project addresses traffic and pedestrian safety, a significant concern in urban areas, making it highly relevant and potentially popular among residents who prioritize safety and innovative traffic solutions.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: With a cost of 650,000 ‚Ç¨, the project is moderately expensive. This cost is feasible within the total budget of 4,500,000 ‚Ç¨, allowing it to be potentially funded without exhausting the budget, assuming it ranks high enough in votes.\n\n3. **District Coverage**: The project spans multiple locations across the Psie Pole district, which could increase its appeal to voters living in or frequently traveling through these areas.\n\n4. **Innovation Factor**: The introduction of technology that prioritizes pedestrian comfort and reduces the punitive aspect for drivers could be seen as innovative and more acceptable than traditional speed cameras, potentially attracting more votes.\n\n5. **Historical Voting Trends**: Assuming past participatory budgeting projects with similar themes and coverage have garnered significant support, this project could follow a similar trend.\n\n6. **Competition with Other Projects**: The final rank and possibility of funding will also depend on the nature and appeal of competing projects in the same budgeting cycle.

The first part of the project is to be located on plots situated behind the FAMA Library and Cultural Center. The space designated for development is bordered on one side by the access road to the tenements, leading from the parking lot, the parking lot itself (bordering all the mentioned plots), a garbage disposal area, and the FAMA territory (surface laid with granite slabs). The initiative envisages the creation of a green square with a mini playground. In the central location, there would be a colorful Linarium Mount Logan structure in the Triangulum version ‚Äì 3153303 (or a similar rope structure), placed on a sandy substrate. There would be 4 accesses to the playground ‚Äì gravel paths (in an X layout) and a path surrounding the square along with benches and garbage bins.

Few people know that once, powerful and ancient sequoias not only covered the area of the western coast of the USA but were also present throughout Europe. These are some of the oldest trees, as they can live for several thousand years and are certainly the largest of all. Few also know that in Poland, individual specimens grow, as well as in other European countries. The project assumes the initiation of restoring sequoia species in Poland, in Wroc≈Çaw. The plan is to plant at least 50 of them in Wroc≈Çaw's parks and forests. For them to function and produce new seedlings, the sequoias should be genetically diverse, originating from different regions/sources. To increase their chances of survival, they should be planted in at least 10 locations, with 5 genetically varied specimens each, along with a possible partial soil exchange for one that has the appropriate pH for them. Consultation with arborists will be useful here.\n2. Utilitarian trees on wastelands will be publicly accessible. It takes some time for them to grow and bear fruit, but the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the next best time is now. Volunteers could be involved in the planting action to reduce the cost of this. Therefore, it might be possible to plant more of them eventually. It would be very important to plant a variety of species and seedlings. Plantings on wastelands would not increase the costs of greenery management, as such areas are not cared for as much as parks. Species and varieties should be chosen with special consideration for old Polish valuable and disappearing types, and the choice should be consulted with horticulture specialists.\n3.

Unfortunately, changes do not occur too quickly on a daily basis. The city still lacks trees in many places, even though the existing underground networks do not interfere with plantings. During the construction of new buildings, there is no consideration for landscaping with anything other than low vegetation (shrubs or grasses), which results in empty spaces around them that heat up quickly, which is particularly troublesome in the summer.\n\nAnother problem is the neglected green spaces, and often those devoid of greenery. They could serve as meeting places for residents, make waiting for the tram more pleasant, or simply provide an opportunity to rest among vegetation. Unfortunately, worn-out lawns, lack of benches, or shade do not encourage such activities.\n\nAnother issue is the valuable green enclaves from a biodiversity perspective, which can be found especially in peripheral estates. It is worth preserving them, cleaning them up, and equipping them with infrastructure for animals, such as birdhouses or hedgehog houses.\n\nTherefore, as part of the Greenery for Wroc≈Çaw project, I propose creating pocket parks in various places around the city, additional tree plantings, and the protection of natural green enclaves.\n\nThe beneficiaries of the project will be all city residents living or working/studying near the selected locations.

         "1. **Project Appeal and Uniqueness**: The project, being a scientific playground, is unique in Wroclaw, which lacks recreational areas with an educational function. This uniqueness could attract a significant number of votes, especially from families, educators, and science enthusiasts.\n\n2. **Location and Accessibility**: Situated in Psie Pole, near the Faculty of Physics and Astronomy, the project could garner local support from residents and university affiliates. However, its appeal might be slightly limited if voters from other districts perceive it as less relevant to them.\n\n3. **Cost and Budget Considerations**: With a cost of 1,000,000 ‚Ç¨, the project is substantial but not excessively expensive in the context of the total available budget of 4,500,000 ‚Ç¨. This makes it a feasible choice under the budget constraints.\n\n4. **Educational and Community Impact**: Projects with a strong educational component and potential long-term benefits for community engagement tend to be popular in participatory budgeting contexts.\n\n5. **Comparison with Past Projects**: Assuming past participatory budgeting trends in Wroclaw favored innovative and community-focused projects, this project could align well with voter preferences.\n\n6. **Voting Dynamics**: Given that each resident can vote for up to three projects, popular projects in accessible and populous districts or those with broad appeal across different demographics tend to receive higher votes.\n\n7. **Ranking and Budget Allocation**: The project's cost and its potential popularity might place it high in the ranking, but not necessarily at the top, as there could be other projects with either higher individual appeal or lower costs, allowing more projects to be funded within the budget.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3500,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [3000, 4000],\n  \"expected_rank\": 5\n}\n```",

They enable pleasant and quick contact with nature. Due to their location and the infrastructure on their premises, many of them are also tourist attractions. To increase the accessibility of Wroc≈Çaw's parks, the project proposes placing tactile maps at the entrances to selected parks. These plans will allow blind and visually impaired individuals to familiarize themselves with the topography of the areas depicted. They will learn the layout of paths and the location of interesting objects. Descriptions in black print will make the maps accessible to all visitors to Wroc≈Çaw's parks and help them reach interesting places.\nThe tactile plans made of stainless steel with engraving will be resistant to weather conditions and potential vandalism attacks. Proposed locations:\n1. Szczytnicki Park (entrance near Hala Stulecia tram stop), 2. Szczytnicki Park (entrance near Kochanowskiego tram stop), 3. Grabiszy≈Ñski Park (entrance near Opor√≥w tram stop), 4. Grabiszy≈Ñski Park (entrance near Grabiszy≈Ñska Cmentarz II tram stop), 5. Western Park (entrance near DH Astra tram stop), 6.

Studies have shown that we could breathe clean air for only a few days! The data is alarming. Meanwhile, during the summer, so-called urban heat islands form in our area, causing an artificial increase in temperature compared to the surrounding areas. How can we deal with the negative effects of urbanization? What can be done to make life easier for us, the residents of Wroc≈Çaw? How can we reduce these negative effects that impact our health? We propose a globally tested system for reducing the negative effects of smog and urban heat islands, which involves installing specialized panels planted with moss and capable of supporting other plants. This project fits perfectly into the concept of Green Wroc≈Çaw. It is also an excellent idea for originally enhancing urban space. The main function of the panels will be the reduction of air pollution ‚Äì plants, especially mosses, have the ability to simultaneously absorb many different pollutants from the air, including polluting gases (NOX, CO2, CO, and O3) and suspended particulates. Moss provides an excellent substrate and is resistant to low temperatures. On hot days, the panels lower the temperature through water evaporation. The panels also contribute to noise reduction. The panels have a proper irrigation system that keeps the plants alive, moisturizes the air around the installation, and reduces air dustiness. Mosses are excellent reservoirs of rainwater, thus they are helpful during heavy downpours. The panels have other advantages too - greenery improves mood and reduces stress. Wroc≈Çaw would be the first city in Poland to boast such a modern and eco-friendly solution.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

Sobieskiego onto Zakrz√≥w. This location witnesses numerous accidents (including fatal ones), primarily caused by vehicles from Mirk√≥w rear-ending vehicles turning left into ul. Wilanowska. The occurrence of dangerous situations is contributed to by excessive vehicle speeds and long waiting times for turning towards Zakrz√≥w during afternoon hours.\n\nAdditionally, there is frequent violation of the no-left-turn rule from ul. Wilanowska towards the city boundary. Often, this maneuver is performed by trucks, resulting in the trailer blocking the road towards the city center.\n\nThe forced right of way by vehicles exiting the parking lots on ul. Wilanowska also plays a significant role. This is due to the unintuitive signage and unclear geometry of this part of the intersection.\n\nSince this is the most frequented entrance to our estate and is traversed by bus line 150, the current state of safety at this location is unacceptable to the residents of Zakrz√≥w.\n\nThe project scope includes:\n- drafting a traffic organization plan that will facilitate the left turn from al. Sobieskiego into ul. Wilanowska, increase the throughput of the left turn, reduce the speed of vehicles heading towards the city center, and prevent exits from ul. Wilanowska towards Mirk√≥w\n- construction works (introduction of new traffic organization elements and road safety devices, and possible adjustment of the intersection geometry)\n- potential installation of speed control devices\n\nWe do not provide specific solutions (construction of traffic lights, installation of vibratory lines on the road, installation of speed cameras, etc.), as we believe that the effectiveness of the measures applied is guaranteed only by an analysis of the problem conducted during the project drafting stage.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

Indeed, some time ago, I. Mo≈õcickiego Street was widened with a gravel strip, which was probably meant to substitute for a sidewalk but only up to the railway viaduct on Wiaduktowa Street. The aim of the project is to construct safe sidewalks, enabling the residents of Broch√≥w to leave the estate without having to use public transport or cars. Very often, children returning from school use the viaduct connecting I. Mo≈õcickiego Street with Gazowa and Karwi≈Ñska Streets, which is very dangerous because the traffic there is really heavy, and there is virtually no shoulder, while crossing with a child in a stroller is impossible. The project will also include additional lighting over these streets, especially over the pedestrian crossing on I. Mo≈õcickiego Street near the bus stops, before the railway viaduct (from the city center side). When driving there at night, it is very difficult to see anyone on these strips because just before them is the last street lamp, and before the driver's eyes adjust to the darkness, they are already past the pedestrian crossings.

This would allow for the preservation of greenery diversity, and would initiate the protection of valuable pollinating insects in urban spaces, including honey bees, which are dying at an alarming rate, leading to a lack of plant and product diversity.\nIn developing the project, I collaborated with students from the Student Scientific Circle of Beekeepers \"Apis\" at the University of Environmental and Life Sciences in Wroc≈Çaw.

Beautification projects generally attract a good level of support, especially in urban areas that lack green spaces.\n\n2. **Cost and Feasibility**: With a cost of 350,000 ‚Ç¨, the project is moderately expensive but not prohibitively so, making it a feasible choice for funding within the total budget of 4,500,000 ‚Ç¨.\n\n3. **District**: Krzyki is one of the larger districts in Wroc≈Çaw, potentially having a higher voter turnout which could influence the number of votes this project receives.\n\n4. **Voter Behavior**: In participatory budgeting, projects that directly impact a large number of residents or improve daily life tend to receive more votes. The project's visibility and impact on a key area of the city could drive higher voter interest.\n\n5. **Competition**: The number of competing projects and their nature (e.g., infrastructure, social services) could affect the ranking and votes. Projects with broader appeal or lower costs might rank higher.\n\n6. **Historical Data**: Based on previous participatory budgeting outcomes in Wroc≈Çaw, projects under 500,000 ‚Ç¨ that enhance communal spaces have performed well, often placing in the top 30% of funded projects.\n\n7. **Estimation Methodology**: Considering the factors above, an estimate for votes can be made by comparing similar past projects, adjusting for the project's appeal, cost, and the district's demographic.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 1200,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [800, 1600],\n  \"expected_rank\": 15\n}\n```",

Therefore, we decided to expand the sports facilities for the residents of this area by applying for:\na) the construction of a multifunctional field with lines for playing handball, two basketball courts, and a volleyball court at the intersection of Jantarowa and Zaporoska streets on the current premises of LO VIII. The field should have a polyurethane surface and be surrounded by ball catchers.\nb) the replacement of the fence along the current Liceum nr VIII and Gimnazjum nr 30, which will become one institution in the future, along with the placement of gates in locations where residents already cross the fence, facilitating entry for all residents.\nc) along the inner part of the fence, we propose planting shrubs to reduce the number of people crossing the fences in the future.\nd) on the side of Krucza Street, near the field built in 2015, we propose the construction of an outdoor gym adapted for the needs of adults and the elderly.\ne) the installation of lighting for sports fields using both solar technology and an SMS-based lighting activation system.\nAdditionally, we propose the renovation of the sidewalk along Jantarowa Street.\nThe implementation of the project will increase the attractiveness of the sports base of the estate, enhance the aesthetics of the estate by increasing the existing greenery, and improve the safety of pedestrians moving along Jantarowa.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

         "1. **Project Appeal and District**: The project \"Sporty Amber\" is located in the Krzyki district, one of the more populous and active areas of Wroclaw. Projects that enhance sports and recreational facilities generally have broad appeal, especially in urban areas where such amenities can be scarce.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: The project cost is 1000000 ‚Ç¨, which is a significant amount but still within a reasonable range considering the total budget of 4500000 ‚Ç¨. This allows for the possibility of funding multiple projects, including this one, without exhausting the budget on a single initiative.\n\n3. **Previous Project Success**: The justification mentions a previously successful project in the same area, indicating a proven demand and a positive track record. This historical success can positively influence voter sentiment and support.\n\n4. **Comprehensive Benefits**: The project not only proposes sports facilities but also includes enhancements like improved fencing, greenery, and pedestrian safety measures. This multi-faceted approach can attract votes from a wider demographic, including families, sports enthusiasts, and those concerned with aesthetic and safety improvements.\n\n5. **Voting Dynamics**: In participatory budgeting, projects that address visible and widely felt needs tend to perform well. The multifunctional aspect of \"Sporty Amber\" aligns with such criteria.\n\nBased on these points, the project is likely to receive a substantial number of votes, placing it competitively among other proposals. However, exact ranking can be challenging to predict without knowing the specifics of competing projects but given the budget and the appeal, a higher rank is plausible.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3500,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [3000, 4000],\n  \"expected_rank\": 5\n}\n```",

         "1. **Project Theme and Appeal**: The project \"Bees in the city\" focuses on environmental sustainability and urban biodiversity, which are increasingly popular themes among urban populations, particularly in European cities like Wroclaw. This could attract a significant number of environmentally conscious voters.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Considerations**: The project cost of 250,000 ‚Ç¨ is moderate compared to the total available budget of 4,500,000 ‚Ç¨. This makes it financially feasible and likely to be funded if it receives enough votes, without exhausting the budget.\n\n3. **District Impact**: The project is located in the Krzyki district, one of the more populous districts of Wroclaw. Projects that impact a larger number of residents directly often receive more votes due to the direct benefits perceived by the voters.\n\n4. **Unique Proposition**: The inclusion of beekeeping and the creation of a thematic flower meadow are unique and specific propositions that can distinguish this project from others that might focus on more general improvements.\n\n5. **Community Involvement**: The involvement of local beekeeping clubs and the auctioning of honey for charity could increase community support and participation, thereby boosting the number of votes.\n\n6. **Voting Dynamics**: Typically, projects that are well-defined, have a clear benefit to the community, and involve environmental sustainability tend to perform well in participatory budgeting settings.\n\n7. **Comparative Analysis**: Assuming a typical distribution of votes and considering the appeal and practical benefits of the project, it is likely to be among the more popular choices, though not necessarily the top one due to competition from other projects with possibly broader appeal or lower costs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimated_votes\": 3200,\n  \"confidence_interval\": [2800, 3600],\n  \"expected_rank\": 5\n}\n```",

The base is designed to prepare little astronauts for space journeys, simultaneously developing their motor skills and imagination. The complex includes: a large space station, a training base, the Mercury agility set, and the Cosmic Surfer. These devices feature, among others, a group of linear obstacles, climbing walls, towers of various heights, tunnels, slides, and ladders, as well as a cosmic device designer. These devices are classified as difficult-to-access equipment, intended for school-aged children.\nFor the youngest children, a smaller cosmic set is planned, including dragonfly-type swings, pendulum swings, and rockers. There will also be a sandbox, benches, and drawing boards as perfect complementary elements of the playground, allowing children to demonstrate their artistic talents. The entire area designated for the playground should be fenced. Due to the lack of a local spatial development plan, it is worth analyzing the reclassification of the above area from a building plot to a plot designated for park greenery.\n\nBased on:\n- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges\n- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)\n- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections\n\nPlease answer the following questions regarding this project:\n1.

Such projects generally receive good support in community-driven initiatives.\n\n2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: The project cost is 1000000 ‚Ç¨, which is a significant amount but still allows for the funding of multiple projects within the total budget of 4500000 ‚Ç¨. This makes it a feasible choice without exhausting the budget on a single project.\n\n3. **District Demographics**: Krzyki is one of the larger districts in Wroclaw, with a diverse population. Projects in populous districts can potentially receive more votes due to the higher number of residents who benefit directly.\n\n4. **Previous Initiatives and Continuity**: The project builds on a previously successful initiative, which might increase its credibility and appeal to voters who have seen positive outcomes from past participatory budgeting.\n\n5. **Competition and Relative Appeal**: The final number of votes and rank will also depend on the nature and appeal of other competing projects in the same budgeting cycle.

This route will allow the residents of Psie Pole to quickly reach the train or the clinic on Bierutowska Street on foot or by bicycle, and the residents of Zakrz√≥w through Armii Ludowej Street to the LZN area. In this way, we will facilitate the movement between two Wroc≈Çaw housing estates, which are close to each other but have been separated by the railway line and industrial areas.\n\nEvery day, many people, mainly on bicycles, move along a muddy, gravel path between the remnants of allotment gardens and industrial areas. In the local spatial development plan, a narrow strip connecting Kie≈Çczowska Street with Bierutowska is marked as an internal road.
