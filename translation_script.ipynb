         "When you live near Place de l'Ormeau, cycling into town is dangerous. Wouldn't it be possible to consider creating a proper bike lane there? The need exists because there is the Anatole France college at the bottom of the avenue. A secure bike path would allow middle school students to cycle. Since the avenue is narrow, could a one-way system not be considered for Avenue Saint-Exupéry and Avenue Jean Rieux? Implementation details - Technical opinion: Improvement of cycling facilities on Avenue Saint-Exupéry. These transitional arrangements will eventually be replaced by the Agglomeration Cycling Network."

         "To promote cohabitation between pedestrians and cyclists, create dedicated and well-defined lanes for each. This includes Alsace Lorraine Street where cohabitation is really complicated and dangerous. And implement measures to ensure these are respected, with reminders if necessary.\n\nImplementation details - Technical opinion:\nDedicating spaces to cyclists or pedestrians separately echoes increasing demands, and ongoing development projects tend to take them into account. This is the case for the redevelopment of Metz Street and the Rive Droite-Rive Gauche project.\n\nAlsace Lorraine Street presents two distinct profiles: an area with a traffic lane for vehicles and a central square without motor vehicle traffic.\n\nCurrently, cyclists predominantly use the central lane designated for automobile traffic.\n\nA pedestrian/cycle separation can be experimented with for 6 months, using yellow markings with bike logos and chevrons in the center of the road and marked counterflow (similar to the concept of a bike street). Repeating the logos every 20 meters will allow clear visualization by pedestrians.\n\nIf this experiment leads to an improvement in terms of pedestrian/cycle usage conflicts, a permanent arrangement can be considered."

         "To add even more majesty to this iconic location in the pink city, this square could be surrounded by greenery: planting of trees, containers... Implementation details - Technical opinion: The development of the Place du Capitole is limited due to a number of constraints:\n- presence of an underground parking lot over much of the square, preventing full-ground plantings,\n- a location in a protected sector, thus requiring prior compliant opinion from the Architecte des Bâtiments de France,\n- numerous events and uses on the square necessitating the maintenance of a surface free of any obstacles.\nHowever, it is possible to deploy square planters of 1.5m by 1.5m or 2m by 2m made of \"Corten\" type steel allowing for the planting of trees. These planters could be placed along the facade of the Capitole to emphasize the rhythm of this building. Additional placements on either side of the square are also conceivable."

These stations combine two factors: 1) The slow release of CO² 2) Volatile organic compounds. In addition to their effectiveness, these stations also have the advantage of respecting biodiversity. They will be placed near public facilities."

         "A neighbor is using a piece of land from the local supermarket to plant seeds and shrubs with their approval; it's private property but visible to everyone. I think the idea is excellent. Why not \"requisition\" all accessible plots of land and plant trees, flowers, vegetables, and let the neighborhood residents take care of them? I believe we need to plant as many trees as possible to help the city maintain lower temperatures, reduce our consumption, make the city more beautiful, and additionally, it could allow us to harvest fruits and vegetables for those who do not have a garden or enough space, or who cannot afford to buy fruits and vegetables. Les Minimes was agricultural land, the soil is rich.\n\nImplementation details - Technical opinion:\nThe Community has launched a Tree Plan since 2019, with nearly 20,000 trees already planted since then. This idea is therefore feasible on public spaces and to implement it, it will be necessary to work in partnership with neighborhood associations on citizen greening projects to find suitable sites. It will then be appropriate to carry out a diagnostic for urban plantings, always because of the networks. Regarding food cultivation, this idea can be part of creating a shared garden, especially in the context of the upcoming redevelopment of the Bourbaki neighborhood, with public consultations expected to start from 2023."

         "Charles de Fitte Alley could use some simple modifications to encourage and facilitate its use by pedestrians and cyclists, especially in the section between Fer-à-Cheval and Place Saint-Cyprien. Currently, buses, cars, and trucks dominate this road, while pedestrians weave through each other and various kinds of litter on sidewalks that are too narrow. As for cyclists, they face the threat of buses and the reckless overtaking by irritated motorcyclists or drivers. My proposals: 1) reworked and better-identified ground markings so that everyone can find their place safely. 2) redefined and more efficient parking zones. For example, by creating angled parking zones, rather than along the edges of sidewalks. 3) always more trees and greenery, especially around the clinic/maternity ward, for the delight of these newborns and their parents.\n\nImplementation modalities - Technical opinion:\nTemporarily redesign Charles de Fitte alleys to facilitate, clarify, and standardize the cycling connections by adjusting the bus and bike lanes. This is only a tactical arrangement since these alleys have been identified as a structural axis of the express bike network and will therefore undergo more significant development in the coming years. Also, greening of the lateral islands between existing trees will be carried out if the project is approved."

         "A sports complex in an urban area",
         "We are a group of young friends, most of us having lived in the Soupetard neighborhood since childhood. We usually meet weekly for sports activities. We've noticed a decline in enthusiasm and civic initiatives in our neighborhood, and today we want to revitalize it through a useful and interesting project for our living environment, especially for different generations. Our project aims to build a sports complex. It will be a Five, a field the size of a city stadium but not the same. It is an enclosed area with synthetic grass and safety railings, delighting those who play 5-a-side football. The outdoor Five is a sport played according to specific rules, unlike football on city stadiums, which is much less regulated and taken less seriously by its players. This project aims to improve the image of the Soupetard neighborhood, to breathe new life into it by creating opportunities for fulfillment for residents, especially the youth. Our goals are: - to promote sports among the youth, - to enhance the Soupetard La Gloire neighborhood, - to enable young people to get involved in their neighborhood, - to improve social connections through football, - to animate the neighborhood and social cohesion, - to open the neighborhood to the rest of the metropolis, - to provide more practical and local access to sports facilities, - to create intergenerational cohesion and diversity, - to bring security and stability around the practice of football, - to provide access to quality facilities for everyone and for actors in the eastern sector, - to ensure that the youth are not wandering aimlessly, - to channel the energy of the youth. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: The project is very interesting to meet the long-expressed needs of the neighborhood's youth. It is technically feasible. The sports department has reservations about the proposed location (within Soupetard school) due to the risk of noise pollution generated by this type of equipment and considering its proximity to residential areas. If the idea wins during the residents' vote, a consultation with the local residents will be organized. If there is strong opposition from the residents about the location proposed by the project leader, another location will be proposed for its realization: at the Soupetard garden, on the concrete esplanade below Boulevard Jacques Chirac."

         "I propose public lighting with motion sensors for nighttime use. The streetlights are turned off at night and only activate upon detecting movement for a few minutes - ensuring safety. This could be implemented on the greenway (Amidonniers), among other places. This system is already being tested in some municipalities in France (in Haute-Vienne, for example). It allows for cost savings and improves the onset and quality of sleep for both humans and birds (see studies on the subject). The investment is low and the implementation quick, with a clear return on investment both financially and in terms of citizen well-being. I hope this idea will be considered, thank you!\n\nImplementation details - Technical opinion:\nThe embedded intelligence in public lighting is the \"smart\" solution for lighting and consuming just enough, while preserving wildlife and flora. However, the technical solution of \"presence\" detection by infrared radar is not optimal: this technique does not provide a sufficient guarantee of detection over time and space (external thermal environments do not allow for reliable detection in case of summer heat, which negates the expected positive effect on wildlife and flora).\n\nThe system in use in the municipality of Toulouse is based on the detection of human \"shapes,\" providing light only when there is actual use of the public space. The detection of shape refers to moving human forms.\n\nThis system has been in service since 2018 on 2000 devices in the city of Toulouse and is planned to be expanded in the coming years."

         "With the covid crisis, no less than 2 hectares of green spaces along the Garonne were closed to the public near the CCAS retirement home in Ducis; these green spaces include wooded areas, lawns, a pond, and the banks of the Garonne with several protected species present. Currently, in the neighborhood, the nearest public green space is either the Barry garden (1km away) or the Raymond VI gardens (2km away), while our neighborhood along the Garonne has many unexploited green space potentials for the residents, including Ducis park (the Roman arenas or the park around the Château de la Flambère can also be mentioned). The goal would be to open the site at the intersection of two neighborhoods, Ancely and Casselardit, with four objectives: - to recreate social links between the residents of the EPHAD and the families/children frequenting the park - to bring an ambition in terms of development (re-greening the space)/management of the park (proposing more extensive management) - to enhance the ecological value of the park included in the green and blue network of the metropolis, which can be integrated into the grand Garonne park and can be valued as a compensation site in the context of local development projects - to raise awareness among nearby schools/residents about biodiversity and the consideration of nature in the city of the Metropolis Among the ideas that could be implemented: - partially replace the weekly mowing of green spaces with extensive mowing/grazing favorable to species of open environments such as eco-grazing - plant trees in targeted sectors to create areas arranged for residents (picnic, relaxation...) as well as cool islands - plant country hedges on the side of Casselardit avenue to isolate the park from the avenue - check for the presence of bats in the castle's attics and propose management monitoring measures (night cameras) - create a shared garden between the school and EPHAD - create a bird-watching area (great cormorant, heron...) between the castle and the Garonne - create a wooden playground, with balance trails To achieve this, a baseline study of the site with the participation of residents/school/EHPAD residents, discovering the unsuspected biodiversity of the park would be necessary. This site fits perfectly into the metropolitan policy in favor of biodiversity (green and blue network / intergenerational citizen participation / 100,000 trees...) This site is also located along a well-frequented cycling path and the GR86. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: A planting program on this site is already established with the choice of species and planting locations. These plantings will be carried out in the fall. The opening to the public of part of the park must respect the constraints related to the reception of the EPHAD residents (health and safety reasons). The installations proposed in this idea must be studied in terms of the cost of purchasing the land."

         "Roguet/St Cyprien Square, a nerve center of the neighborhood, a commercial, trading, and residential area, suffers from a significant lack of greenery. It is also a major traffic hub. During the increasingly frequent scorching summers, crossing the square can sometimes be a challenge, as the mineral surface stores and reflects heat. Unfortunately, the few improvements made to the square are insufficient to make it livable. A massive greening of the square would significantly reduce the temperature, dampen traffic noise, and purify the atmosphere.\n\nImplementation details - Technical opinion:\nGreening of Roguet Square, with the installation of planted beds, while maintaining the current uses of the square (terraces, market...). This project will be refined based on technical constraints due to the presence of underground networks.\n\nRegarding the inner Saint-Cyprien Square, this project requires more comprehensive reflection in connection with the integration of the future Express Vélo on the Charles de Fitte alleys, and the cost of development is significantly higher than €200,000, so a comprehensive project has been ruled out from the study. However, vegetated totems (see a reference example by clicking here) can be deployed in the most mineral areas to cool the square."

This solution is part of biodiversity preservation and the ecosystem-based approach, but it is not the most appropriate for combating the tiger mosquito. Other solutions such as oviposition traps should be prioritized because they target a key and unavoidable stage in the life cycle of the tiger mosquito and are specific to this species.

Currently, Amat Massot square lacks maintenance. It primarily serves as a spot for illegal parking, the ground and furniture (a few benches) are worn out, and it is regularly invaded by trash and dog droppings, making this space unpleasant, underused, and squatted. However, due to its location (near a middle school, high school, clinic, nursing home, future metro line) and the trees already planted, it has great potential and is just waiting to be enhanced!\n\nOur proposal:\n1. Rehabilitate the square\n   - Rehabilitate the stabilized (non-asphalted, non-grassed) grounds\n   - Replace and supplement the furniture\n   - Install a dispenser for dog waste bags (trash bins are already available)\n   - Define the square's boundaries and combat illegal parking by installing planters and vegetated posts\n   - Incorporate bicycle racks\n\n2. Bring back plant and animal biodiversity\n   - Create flower beds by mixing species and varieties of plantings to ensure biodiversity\n   - Install birdhouses, especially for tits, which will help control mosquitoes\n   - Integrate an insect hotel that would be built during a workshop led by the Collective (a project already carried out by members of the collective in a neighborhood school)\n   - Set up a dwelling for hedgehogs, which are very common in the neighborhood\n\n3. Recreate a place for intergenerational life and meeting\n   - Integrate a few community garden plots that the Collective commits to maintaining through gardening workshops\n   - Place a book exchange box\n   - Provide a chess table\n   - If the city hall allows it and confirms feasibility, propose to customize benches with nature-themed mosaics\n\nWe are at your disposal to present the project in more detail, including sharing a draft model with you!\n\nImplementation modalities - Technical opinion:\nA study can be conducted by the competent municipal and metropolitan services to transform this space into a neighborhood square by creating meeting spaces between neighbors and enhancing its vegetal character. A consultation would then be launched with the project initiator, neighborhood associations, and the residents of the concerned neighborhood."

Also, on Grande Bretagne Avenue, the concrete blocks preventing access to Charpak Street could be temporarily replaced by planters pending a permanent arrangement. Regarding Grande Bretagne Avenue, this option has been set aside for now because a rapid bike network (REV) project is planned on this axis to improve cyclist movement, and plantings will only be carried out once the arrangements are in place to avoid damaging the plantings. For your information, Lombez Avenue is also identified as an axis of the REV to improve bicycle traffic.

It seems possible to plant some remarkable trees as opportunities arise and to diversify the plant palette of the neighborhood. - Planting flowering trees such as Paulownia would contrast with the very large trees on Avenue de l'URSS. (\"Imperial tree,\" is a tree native to central China. It grows quickly but does not exceed 10 to 12 meters in height (thus suitable for small gardens), and its spreading form is very elegant.) - Planting perennial plants at the base of shrubbery clusters would be a response to the search for biodiversity and fertile habitat.

Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: Greening of Saint Roch Street through tree planting. Perennial plants will be planted at the base of the trees to provide a fertile habitat for urban biodiversity. The proposal to plant Paulownia species, which have high environmental and aesthetic value, is not suitable for the profile of this street. Species such as “Chinese Pear,” “White Serviceberry,” or “Lutèce Elm” would more adequately address the greening of this road (subject to compatibility with underground networks).

Our Association, after detailed surveys of the functioning of this place (behaviors of residents, pedestrian, bicycle, car traffic, and parking), concluded the possibility of restructuring this emblematic site for the \"Pont des Demoiselles\" neighborhood heart. This would lead to:\n- Creating a large green square in place of the current parking lot.\n- Simplifying the organization of bicycle and car flows by eliminating, in particular, the intersections of different traffics in the funnel located between the square and Saint-Exupéry avenue.\n- Facilitating and securing the movements of bicycles and scooters, which are numerous to use this compulsory passage between the northern part of the neighborhood, educational establishments, the Canal du Midi track, and beyond to the city center or the university campus.\n- Offering pedestrians a comfortable and pleasant site to cross towards and from Pradal street, which will lead them to the Jean Rieux station of the TAE metro line, and whose narrowest sidewalk sections should be widened by 2028.\n- Maintaining a parking offer along the reorganized roads to meet the needs of the businesses and services of the neighborhood heart, managing it through regulations that stimulate good usage rotation.\n\nIf the funding associated with the call for ideas allowed it, why not start some of the work or actions related to this restructuring, which seems essential to us in the medium term and would bring back, under the plane trees, greenery, children's games, perhaps an open-air market at the heart of the neighborhood, etc.\n\nImplementation modalities - Technical opinion:\nRoger Arnaud square is part of the perimeter of a \"Cœur de quartier\" operation by Toulouse Métropole.

         "Like other municipalities in the metropolis, it would be useful to consider the town hall's participation in the costs of nest boxes for swifts and bats (a bulk order by the town hall would also help to reduce the unit price) for a collective fight against the tiger mosquito. These nest boxes would be distributed to individuals who would place them at their homes. Similarly, participation in traps for larvae or adult tiger mosquitoes could also be considered. \n\nImplementation details - Technical opinion:\nRegarding bats, they are useful against mosquitoes (notably of the Culex genus). Against tiger mosquitoes (of the Aedes genus), which notably bite during the day, bats - which are active at dusk or nocturnal - cannot deploy their full effectiveness. For biodiversity reasons, it is very useful to promote the installation of bats in the territory, but in the context of combating the presence of the tiger mosquito, other solutions should be prioritized. Swifts are part of the daytime avifauna that preys on flying insects. However, their flight paths are too high for tiger mosquitoes, and the installation of nest boxes is excluded because for the nest boxes to be colonized, they must be installed near an existing colony or be part of a playback campaign (audio tape playing the calls of swifts).\n\nNest boxes for swallows might be more interesting because the flight height of swallows makes them natural predators of flying insects, like the tiger mosquito. In terms of colonization, the same difficulties apply as for swifts. Implementing oviposition traps seems to be the most appropriate idea, however, care must be taken as this measure must be adopted by the Municipal Council to be implemented and, if this is the case, it would be generalized for the entire territory of Toulouse, thus requiring a significant budget.\n\nCost per nest box: 30 euros.\nCost of oviposition traps: 30 euros for 2. A budget of approximately 60,000 euros is needed to equip the private spaces of Toulouse and 12,000 euros to equip the public spaces."

         "This idea was submitted via a paper form by Maïté. I regularly pass along Chemin de la Fronde and I notice that the green spaces are frequented by high school students, employees from nearby businesses, and residents of the neighborhood. These spaces are not being showcased well. It would be inexpensive to improve the condition of these areas to make them more pleasant with new plantings and by creating picnic areas. We are fortunate to have green spaces; we might as well enhance them.\n\nImplementation details - Technical opinion:\nThe project is coherent and technically feasible. It will beautify the site with new furniture (picnic tables + benches + trash bins) and the planting of some new vegetation so that residents can enjoy it. However, be mindful of potential noise disturbances, especially at night, that such developments might cause. A consultation with the residents living adjacent to this site could be considered."

On the other hand, Saint-Sernin Square has undergone a major redevelopment, during which more than 80 trees were planted. A garden was created at the apse of the basilica, and a garden/playground was established in the courtyard of the St-Sernin gymnasium (replacing a parking lot). On Saint-Sernin Square, the tree planting was regulated (UNESCO World Heritage site) but also constrained by the presence of archaeological remains at a very shallow depth (-20cm on the forecourt, -40cm in front of the high school). Therefore, the decision was made to elevate the ground to allow for tree planting. Additional plantings are not feasible. This part of the proposal will not be put to a vote."

Implementation details - Technical opinion: It is proposed to redevelop this area by implementing tactical and transitional urban planning measures. If this idea is adopted, it will be possible to improve pedestrian crossings between the building base and the riverbanks, to prohibit vehicle parking, and to create a dedicated pedestrian space for the right bank quay. If greening is not the initial goal envisioned (since it is the spirit of the port and the quay that, according to the Grand Parc Canal study, must prevail), this project proposes: the installation of large communal tables and seating furniture, which could be paired with shade structures to provide shade during the hottest hours. This development will promote new uses that are both peaceful and convivial."

         "With the recent arrival of the Toulouse cable car, the residents of the neighborhood see their living spaces transforming. The green base of Pech David, where the observatory is located and which is so adored by walkers, families, and Toulouse athletes, is altering and gradually changing its face. It is mutating into a parking area that extends further and further, where the car - although we are in an era increasingly concerned about our planet - aspires to become the queen (parking on the grass, on the edge of the cliff, around the observatory, even on hiking trails...). Yet our queen is the Pech David area. We see its flora and fauna changing; the ways of enjoying this space deteriorated. Indeed, for the past two years, it has been an open-air parking lot that modifies the uses and frequentations of this site and our neighborhood. Our wish is then to bring back to the forefront the active, family, and sports dynamics of Pech David. We would like developments aimed at respecting the place for what it represents to our city, as a green lung, but especially for our neighborhood. We then imagine relaxation and exchange areas (on the ground or through eco-responsible furniture). Pétanque or mölkky courts transforming the path dedicated to the cable car works into small game fields. Above all, we would like to restore the green spaces to bring back nature, sacrificed in the name of the automobile and the ease of access for Toulouse residents. They could actually reuse the initial parking areas (parking on the other side of the observatory road, parking at the stadiums after the equestrian center,...), and walk to the observatory site. It is with great respect for our neighborhood, but also for our city that as young Toulouse residents, athletes, and lovers of Pech David, we hope that this project will be retained. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion:\nDevelopment of sports and relaxation areas at the Pech-David observatory site. This project would consist of installing several picnic tables shaded by tree plantations around the observatory, not far from the water tower. In addition, outdoor sports facilities (pétanque court, area for mölkky...) as well as seating would be installed. This project would complement the security and accessibility improvements of the observatory site (renovation of pedestrian paths, installation of signage...), already planned by the community."

         "Greening Matabiau Street",
         "Matabiau Street is one of the main gateways to the hyper-center of Toulouse. With numerous typical buildings and a dynamic neighborhood life, this street remains a heat island and generally lacks nature. Therefore, we propose to green Matabiau Street along the segment between Jeanne D'Arc Square and Roquelaine Square (the section of the street that can be most quickly and easily adapted), in order to create a healthy and sustainable environment. For this purpose, we propose the installation of planters and trees by encroaching on some parking spaces, and the implementation of a policy to encourage the flowering of balconies with hanging planters. Specifically, we propose the installation of between 12 and 20 trees/shrubs on the odd-numbered side of the street (where parking spaces are located), with flower beds in giant planters integrated into the urban environment. These planters would be placed on the roadway (so as not to reduce pedestrian space), between certain parking spaces or in place of some of them. Some delivery areas (which are mostly used for parking) would be reduced. To encourage harmonious balcony flowering, we propose that the city council select a model of planter suitable for Toulouse balconies, and offer the possibility of purchasing them at reduced prices for each resident of the street, with a proposal of robust and flowering plant species to plant (e.g., various colors of pelargonium, heather, ivy...). The goal of this project is to provide shade in a busy wide street, in the same way that was done for the nearby Rue de la Concorde. This project would involve both the municipality and the residents of the street. In a second phase, it could also be considered to green certain facades, particularly those of public buildings such as the Matabiau School. The greening of the urban space would improve air quality, reduce heat islands, and enhance the quality of life for the neighborhood's residents.\n\nImplementation Details - Technical Opinion:\nThe greening of Roquelaine Square is a project currently under study by the Community. The architect of the French buildings wishes to develop an urban forest incorporating a playground over the entire area of the square. The budget for this type of development is around €500,000 and cannot be included in this call for projects.\n\nRegarding Matabiau Street, in order not to constrain a possible future street development project, a system of planters can be considered on the parking spaces. This type of development will require road support as these elements could constitute obstacles on the roadway and present a danger to cyclists."

         "Greening and conviviality of the Saint-Aubin neighborhood",
         "To combat urban heat islands and also to make the neighborhood more pleasant, a simple solution is to green the streets and open spaces by removing asphalt whenever possible. In the neighborhood, many spaces are suitable for this. Numerous plant species (trees, shrubs, and flowers) are adapted to our very dry climates in summer. See, for example, the guides published by CEREMA, a national body that Toulouse Métropole has also consulted on the subject: https://www.cerema.fr/fr/actualites/accompagnement-toulouse-metropole-identifier-potentiel Moreover, removing asphalt from the ground is far preferable to simply placing planters because it contributes to the de-impermeabilization of the soil. Watering these full-soil areas could be done by partially diverting rainwater. This greening must be accompanied by the installation of street furniture (benches, chairs, playgrounds for children) allowing residents to reclaim their neighborhood. For example, we propose:\n- Rue Riquet: de-asphalt parking spaces (for example, alternate 2-3 green spaces with 4-5 parking spaces). The freed space will be planted with trees, shrubs, or floral beds depending on the constraints related to underground networks. Such an arrangement could also be done on Rue Gabriel Péri.\n- Rue Riquet / on Place Saint-Aubin where the sidewalks are wide: replace the poles with an 80 cm wide green strip.\n- Place Bachelier: this square is large and entirely mineral. There is enough space to install trees but also large full-soil flower beds. It would also be possible to install benches, for example, circular benches around the newly planted trees. This square could become a cool island.\n- Around Saint-Aubin church: install benches under the shade of trees.\n\nImplementation details - Technical opinion:\nOn Place Saint-Aubin, the presence of the market strongly constrains any installation in these spaces. Additional greening seems complex given the uses of this square.\nMoreover, the presence of an underground parking in front of the church allows little or no full-soil planting.\nHowever, a study for the installation of planters to green the pergolas at the parking entrances is underway.\nRegarding Rue Riquet, the greening project should be discussed in September with local residents and shopkeepers.\nFor Place Bachelier, it is possible to plant trees, up to 3 in number."

Awareness and prevention efforts among the population are necessary but do not seem sufficient, nor do individual initiatives by some residents. The inhabitants of Lafourguette wish for the installation of equipment in the public sectors of the neighborhood: pheromone mosquito terminals, shelters for bats, or swallow nest boxes (see point H above). We particularly propose that the initiative carried out by the Toulouse City Hall in various municipal nurseries and schools in Toulouse be deployed within the perimeter of our neighborhood.\n\nImplementation modalities - Technical opinion:\nThe Toulouse City Hall already uses mosquito terminals, especially in early childhood areas. Their operating principle is to mimic human presence and capture at the biting stage. In the presence of the public, the terminal will trap mosquitoes, but other individuals will continue to bite.\n\nThe system could be complemented by the installation of 40 breeding traps in the neighborhood to combat tiger mosquitoes. The breeding traps stop the proliferation (laying) and capture tiger mosquitoes. Specific to this species, this solution intervenes at a key and unavoidable stage of the tiger mosquito's life cycle; Bat nest boxes are less relevant because bats are active at dusk or even nocturnal, and tiger mosquitoes particularly bite during the day (morning and early evening before nightfall), thus they are not the most appropriate predators to combat these mosquitoes."

Working on the neglected shoulders along the canal and recalibrating the lanes could allow for a more comfortable 1.75-meter-wide cycle lane, without reducing the number of lanes dedicated to motorists.
