Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Rędziński Park
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The concept of the Park in Maślice was designed based on a survey conducted among its current users. It takes into account two main target groups: families with children and young, active sports enthusiasts. Currently, this area is perceived by residents as a green space—unfortunately, neglected. Given the development of the estate and the need to create new meeting places for residents, as well as Wrocław's efforts to earn the title of European Green Capital, this area should gain a new look.

The park development project includes paths, prepared based on the state of tree cover and potential costs of clearing the trails to a minimum width of 2.5 m—cycling, running, and walking paths—leveled and prepared for stroller access. Additionally, the project includes health trail routes connected by crossings made of wooden bridges, culverts, and balance beams. The paths will be connected to sandy squares where wooden play equipment and willow wigwams will be located. The park's hill will also be utilized—it will be planted with a spiral hedge, and plastic slides will be built into its sides. At the top, there will be a viewing point with a circular gazebo and swing benches.

The park paths will be equipped with a series of educational and sensory boards. Existing blackberry hedges will be densified with raspberry bushes in various varieties and fruiting seasons. The concept also includes the development of two water reservoirs. Two crossings over them in the form of wooden bridges are planned. Near one of the ponds, there will be a spot for exercises with a shock-absorbing surface and a place for outdoor gym equipment. The area will also feature two fire pits, gazebos, benches, and wooden loungers made from tree trunks.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

**INSTRUCTIONS DE SORTIE**  
Start with a “Step Back”:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Rędziński Park, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"Step Back:
In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to a broad demographic, its visibility and perceived utility, the cost relative to available budget, and the district's voting patterns and project competition.

Analysis of Rędziński Park:
1. The project is located in the Krzyki district, which historically receives a high average number of votes per project, indicating strong voter engagement.
2. The cost of the project is 1,000,000 €, aligning with several other high-ranking projects from previous years, suggesting it's within a typical budget range for popular projects.
3. The project's focus on green space and recreational facilities is similar to other successful projects, such as the Playground for Older Children in Grabiszyński Park and the Green cycling and walking ring road.
4. The detailed and community-focused nature of the project, aimed at both families and sports enthusiasts, could appeal to a broad audience, increasing its potential vote count.
5. Competition within the district includes 18 projects this year, which is slightly higher than previous years, potentially dispersing votes among more options.
6. Given the project's similarities to previously successful projects and its alignment with Wroclaw's green initiatives, it is likely to perform well, though exact ranking might be affected by the unknown specifics of competing projects.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: bus stop infrastructure on Dawida Street
- Cost: 250000 €
- District: Śródmieście
- Description: Justification
On Dawida Street (between Dawida Street and Dyrekcyjna Street) there is a bus loop for private carriers, which is heavily used by many residents of Wrocław and people living in the surrounding areas within several dozen kilometers. Unfortunately, Dawida Street lacks decent infrastructure - sidewalks (the existing concrete ones are in poor condition and are uncomfortable to use, especially in winter), bus shelters (even just to protect against rain), benches, street lamps, trash bins, or clear timetables (there are several stops and if someone is not familiar with them, i.e., does not know from which stop a particular carrier departs, it can be a bit confusing). Changes would enable more pleasant and easier use of this bus loop.
I qualify this project as city-wide, as residents from various parts of the city and from nearby towns use this infrastructure.
P.S. I heard that the city plans to change the location of the stops for private carriers - if this is the case, please inform me and possibly then the project will be withdrawn.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: ""Park & ride"" at the Pilczyce/Wrocław Stadium loop
- Cost: 750000 €
- District: Fabryczna
- Description: Justification
""Park & ride"" are parking facilities for those coming to large cities wishing to use public transport. It is an eco-friendly solution used in modern large cities. The project plans to create 80 parking spaces. Due to the proximity of the A8 motorway entrance to the city and the Pilczyce loop (100m), the parking is ideally located for use by people coming from outside Wrocław, who will leave their car in the parking lot and switch to public transport (tram lines: 33, 3, 10, 20; bus line: 128). Additionally, the spaces can be used by people driving to mass events organized at the Municipal Stadium (300m). The implementation of the project will increase the safety of residents and cars parked during events at the stadium. It will also improve the image of the city of Wrocław (especially during stadium events). It will prevent the devastation of green areas. Currently, during mass events at the stadium, due to cars parked on the road, dangerous situations and collisions occur. Due to the lack of space, cars are unable to pass or turn around. Often, they have to back out of the alley up to 200 m. There is devastation of green areas due to the blocked road (passing through lawns and sidewalks) or parking on the lawns.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

Start with a “Step Back”:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project ""Park & ride"" at the Pilczyce/Wrocław Stadium loop, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"**Step Back:**
In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and perceived utility, cost, and the distribution of projects across different districts. Projects that address widespread concerns or offer broad benefits tend to gather more votes.

**Analysis of ""Park & ride"" at the Pilczyce/Wrocław Stadium loop:**
1. **District Voting Patterns**: The project is in the Fabryczna district, which has historically seen high voter engagement and support for projects, with an average vote count higher than some other districts.
2. **Project Cost and Budget Impact**: The project cost (750,000 €) is moderate and similar to other projects that have successfully been funded in the past, suggesting it might be favorably considered within budget constraints.
3. **Utility and Appeal**: The project addresses a practical need for parking and aims to reduce traffic congestion, which is a significant issue in urban settings, potentially increasing its appeal.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: A similar project in a different district received 1608 votes and ranked 26th. Given the strategic location near the A8 motorway and the stadium, this project might attract more votes due to higher perceived utility.
5. **Socio-Ecological Benefits**: The project promotes the use of public transport, aligning with broader environmental goals, which could appeal to environmentally conscious voters.
6. **Historical Data from Similar Projects**: Projects with a transportation and ecological angle in the same district have received a varied number of votes, but generally, projects with a clear utility like this tend to perform moderately well.
7. **Event-Driven Demand**: The proximity to the stadium and the description of problems during events provide a clear, event-driven rationale for the project, which could sway voters who experience these issues firsthand.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Operation Square - Street Games ""Taming the Concrete""
- Cost: 150000 €
- District: Śródmieście
- Description: Justification
The project involves placing street games in urban spaces designed for children of various age groups.
The project has two main objectives:
- encourage children to play in urban spaces
- make use of hardened surfaces such as concrete, asphalt, or paving stones.
Street games made of thermoplastic material are a supplement to traditional playgrounds or an idea for utilizing alleys, courtyards, and wastelands, and can serve as a modern educational aid especially for preschool, early school, and physical education teachers, as well as an idea for actively spending free time for entire families.
By transforming gray courtyards and squares into colorful zones for play and learning, we show children
that one can have great fun away from the screen of a monitor and television.
Thermoplastic material is characterized by high resistance to weather conditions, includes anti-slip elements, and the colors do not lose their intensity.
The installation of Smart Plac games involves the thermoplastic material vulcanizing with the hardened surface during heating (with asphalt, paving stones, or concrete), which ensures high durability and longevity of the product.

In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to a broad audience, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of projects across different districts which might affect local voter interest and turnout.

**Analysis of the Project ""Development of the bathing area in Oporów"":**
1. **District Voting History**: Fabryczna has historically shown strong support for community and recreational projects, as evidenced by high votes for similar projects like ""Ping-pong tables and volleyball courts throughout Wrocław"" and ""Unity Park – urban recreation"".
2. **Project Cost**: At 1,000,000 €, the project is expensive, which means it needs a substantial number of votes to be considered for funding. This cost aligns with several other high-ranked projects from previous years.
3. **Project Appeal**: The project includes a variety of features (playgrounds, sports facilities, environmental improvements) that have broad appeal, similar to other successful projects in the district.
4. **Competition**: With 50 projects in the running and 6 in the same district, the competition is significant, but the project's comprehensive nature might give it an edge.
5. **Voter Engagement**: Given the project's community and recreational focus, it is likely to engage a wide demographic, similar to the top projects from previous years.
6. **Historical Data**: Projects with similar themes and costs in Fabryczna received between 3000 to 4000 votes, suggesting a strong baseline of support.
7. **Budget Constraints**: The total budget and the cost of the project imply that not all high-cost projects will be funded, but historically, projects with costs around 1,000,000 € have been successful if they ranked in the top 10.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: I'm sorry, but you didn't provide any text to translate. Please provide the text you would like translated from Polish to English.
- Cost: 50000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The idea behind the ""1997"" project was to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the residents' struggle with the flood, which has been remembered as the Flood of the Millennium.
Twenty locations were selected where a delicate, elongated, copper plaque with the cut-out numbers 1997 will be mounted. The defined places - facades of buildings that had to face the powerful element on July 12-13, 1997, are characteristic points in the city center and housing estates.
The project's aim is to make visitors aware and remind locals of the hardships that the residents of Wrocław had to overcome for life in the city to return to normal. A city-wide nature of the proposal was chosen to illustrate the actual scale of the flood.
The proposal is characterized by modesty; the rectangular plaques are meant to address the flood in a non-didactic way, to intrigue. The proposed size is 40 cm in length and 3 cm in width. The thickness is 1 cm, so as to conceal the mounting. The height of the mounting depends on the water level from July 1997.

In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, with each voter allowed to choose up to three projects. The total budget is allocated using a greedy algorithm, funding the most popular projects first until the budget is exhausted. Projects that are too costly relative to the remaining budget are skipped.

**Analysis:**
1. **Cost Effectiveness**: The project cost (50,000 €) is significantly lower than many other projects, potentially allowing it to be easily funded within the available budget.
2. **Historical and Emotional Appeal**: The project commemorates a significant historical event (the 1997 flood), which could resonate emotionally with many voters, especially those affected or familiar with the event.
3. **District Voting Patterns**: Krzyki district has shown strong support for projects, with high average votes in previous elections. This could benefit the project.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar low-cost projects in the district have received a moderate number of votes (e.g., Frisbee Golf with 477 votes).
5. **Visibility and Impact**: The project's visibility might be lower compared to large-scale infrastructure projects, which could affect its total votes.
6. **Innovativeness and Engagement**: The project's unique approach to commemorating history through plaques may not engage as broad an audience as more interactive or directly beneficial projects.
7. **Competition**: With 18 projects in Krzyki this year, the competition could dilute the votes among many options.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Safe and friendly roads in Wrocław - speed calming lights instead of speed cameras throughout the city
- Cost: 650000 €
- District: Psie Pole
- Description: Justification
The project proposes changing the operating mode of traffic lights at selected intersections to improve pedestrian comfort and overall safety. The main change will be switching the signals to an ""all-green"" mode for pedestrians – meaning that when there are no cars on the road, the green light will continuously be on at crosswalks, allowing pedestrians to cross freely without having to press buttons and wait. The change occurs only when a column of cars approaches. The second feature would be slowing lights - when a car approaches an intersection or a pedestrian crossing with traffic lights, its speed is monitored by cameras, and if it is driving too fast, the light turns red. The green light comes back on once it reduces speed - if it does not, the camera records the moment of running the red light, and only then is a fine issued. This system is much more driver-friendly than the traditional speed camera - if someone's foot lingers on the gas pedal, they do not immediately receive a fine, but a warning in the form of a red light, and only if they ignore it are they penalized. It is also a more effective solution - it reduces speed in the most dangerous places, namely at intersections and pedestrian crossings. Slowing lights are operational in Wrocław at the intersection of Ślężna and Weigla, so this is not a novelty in our city.
Proposals:
1. Krakowska – pedestrian crossing (signal no. 231)
2. Bardzka – pedestrian crossing (signal no. 243)
3. Popowicka – pedestrian crossing
4. Klecińska – allotment gardens (signal no. 200)
5. Grabiszyńska – Bzowa (signal no. 219)

Analysis of ""Safe and friendly roads in Wrocław - speed calming lights instead of speed cameras throughout the city"":
1. The project's cost of 650,000 € is moderate compared to other projects, making it a feasible choice under budget constraints.
2. It is located in the Psie Pole district, which historically has had a lower average number of votes per project compared to other districts.
3. Similar projects in terms of theme (traffic and safety improvements) have received a moderate number of votes, suggesting a consistent but not overwhelming interest in such initiatives.
4. The project's innovative approach to traffic management might appeal to voters who prefer non-punitive measures to traffic control.
5. The project's ranking in the previous election was 18th with 2070 votes, indicating a decent base level of support that could potentially be built upon in the current election.
6. Given the project's previous performance and the average voting patterns in Psie Pole, it is unlikely to break into the top 5 but has a potential to be in the top 10 if voter interest in safety and innovative traffic solutions has increased.
7. The project's relevance to everyday commuter experiences in Wrocław could help in garnering more votes, especially if promoted effectively during the campaign period.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Network of parks in Wrocław – Psie Pole - Zawidawie 2
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Stare Miasto
- Description: Justification
The aim of the project is to create two green areas in the Psie Pole -Zawidawie district - a green square at Psie Pole (behind FAMA) and part of the park at Zakrzów. Connecting areas located on two different sides of Sobieski Avenue aims to activate residents of the entire district around a common project within the framework of WBO 2017. The first part of the project is to be located on plots situated behind the FAMA Library and Cultural Center. The space designated for development is bordered on one side by the access road to the tenements, leading from the parking lot, the parking lot itself (bordering all the mentioned plots), a garbage disposal area, and the FAMA territory (surface laid with granite slabs). The initiative envisages the creation of a green square with a mini playground. In the central location, there would be a colorful Linarium Mount Logan structure in the Triangulum version – 3153303 (or a similar rope structure), placed on a sandy substrate. There would be 4 accesses to the playground – gravel paths (in an X layout) and a path surrounding the square along with benches and garbage bins. The remaining parts would be occupied by flower beds (perennials blooming from spring to autumn) and trees – small-leaved lindens. The second part of the project involves the development of a plot located at Zakrzów, in an area bounded by Kujbyszewska, Królewska, and Zatorska streets. In this space, the plan includes the creation of an irregular gravel path/paths, an integration square for the residents of Os. Sobieski, and a dog run (this is consistent with the concept concerning Unity Park, WBO 2014 project). Additionally, new lawns will be established and trees planted in the designed space. This part of the park will also feature bicycle racks, trash bins, and benches.

Start with a “Step Back”:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Network of parks in Wrocław – Psie Pole - Zawidawie 2, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"**Step Back:**
In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to a broad demographic, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of projects across different districts which might affect local voter interest and turnout.

**Analysis of the project ""Network of parks in Wrocław – Psie Pole - Zawidawie 2"":**
1. **District Voting Patterns:** The project is in Stare Miasto, a district with historically lower average votes per project compared to others like Krzyki and Fabryczna.
2. **Project Cost:** At 1,000,000 €, it's a high-cost project, which means it needs a significant number of votes to justify its budget allocation.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar high-cost projects in the same district received votes ranging from 2081 (Dog Field without traffic jams) to lower rankings with fewer votes. This suggests a challenging environment for high-cost projects in this district.
4. **Theme and Relevance:** The project focuses on urban green spaces, which aligns with popular themes in previous elections (e.g., Trees for Wrocław, Unity Park). This could enhance its appeal.
5. **Project Visibility and Scope:** The project covers multiple areas and includes features like playgrounds and dog runs, potentially increasing its appeal to a broader demographic, including families and pet owners.
6. **Historical Data and Trends:** Projects with a focus on green spaces and recreational areas have performed variably, but those that are well-integrated into community needs tend to do better.
7. **Economic and Social Context:** Given the ongoing global emphasis on sustainable urban development, this project might tap into broader ecological and social trends favoring green projects.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Green stops in the city center
- Cost: 320000 €
- District: Fabryczna
- Description: Justification
The project proposes the creation of green stops at selected locations in downtown Wrocław by planting climbing plants on their structures. The vegetation would grow in boxes and would be introduced onto lattices along the sides and back wall of the shelters, without interfering with their structure. Thanks to the planting of climbers, waiting for public transport vehicles will become more pleasant, and the bus shelters will gain a new, more aesthetic form.
The project is part of efforts to earn Wrocław the title of Green Capital of Europe, adds a new aesthetic value to the urban space, and introduces greenery in places that have been devoid of it until now. Similar structures have been successfully functioning for years in many cities including London, Eindhoven, Novi Sad, and this year, Kraków plans to introduce green stops.
Proposed locations for green stops:
- Main Station (3 stops)
- Arkady Capitol (2 stops)
- Bema Square (2 stops)
- Galeria Dominikańska (2 stops)
- Strzegomski Square (Contemporary Museum) (2 stops)

Analysis of ""Green stops in the city center"":
1. The project's theme aligns with previously successful projects in Wroclaw, such as those focusing on greenery and urban aesthetics, which have historically garnered substantial voter support.
2. The cost of the project (320,000 €) is relatively moderate compared to other projects, potentially allowing it to be funded even after higher-cost projects have been selected.
3. The project is located in the Fabryczna district, which has shown strong support for green and urban improvement projects in previous elections.
4. The project's innovative approach to enhancing bus stops could appeal to a wide demographic, including daily commuters and environmental advocates.
5. The project's visibility and direct impact on daily life (improving the aesthetics and comfort of bus stops) could enhance its appeal compared to less tangible projects.
6. Given the average and range of votes for similar projects in the same district, it is likely to perform well but may not reach the very top due to competition with other appealing projects.
7. The project's cost-effectiveness and practical benefits could place it within the top 10, considering the voting patterns and budget allocation strategy.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Reagan Roundabout up to standard! Construction of platforms at Reagan Roundabout.
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Psie Pole
- Description: Justification
Reagan Roundabout is one of the more important transit hubs. Unfortunately, the low edges of the stops make it difficult for the elderly, disabled, or parents with strollers to board. As a result, the boarding and alighting of passengers take longer - we ALL lose out! Enough of the uncomfortable climb into buses or trams!
This is a continuation of the WBO 2016 project no. 82. In the previous edition, project 82 and 686 (convergent) together gathered over 1200 votes, indicating significant interest from residents in the matter of convenient boarding at this important transit point.
The proposed changes include raising the platforms by at least 25 cm on the eastern side (2 platforms from Norwida Street) to minimize the gap during boarding.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

**INSTRUCTIONS DE SORTIE**  
Start with a “Step Back”:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Reagan Roundabout up to standard! Construction of platforms at Reagan Roundabout., listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"**Step Back:**
In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, with each voter allowed to vote for up to three projects. The total budget is allocated using a greedy algorithm, funding the most popular projects first until the budget is exhausted. Projects that are too costly relative to the remaining budget are skipped. The success of a project in this system is influenced by its appeal to a wide audience, its visibility and perceived utility, and its cost relative to other competing projects.

**Analysis of ""Reagan Roundabout up to standard! Construction of platforms at Reagan Roundabout."":**
1. **District Voting History:** Projects in Psie Pole have historically received fewer votes compared to other districts like Krzyki. The average votes for projects in Psie Pole were around 1533.3, which is lower than the city average.
2. **Previous Similar Projects:** A similar project at Reagan Roundabout in the previous election received only 705 votes, indicating moderate interest.
3. **Project Cost:** The cost of 1,000,000 € is significant and will consume a considerable portion of the budget, which might affect its chances if there are many other popular lower-cost projects.
4. **Utility and Visibility:** The project addresses a clear need for accessibility, which could appeal to a broad audience, particularly those concerned with mobility issues.
5. **Continuation Factor:** The project is a continuation of previous efforts, which might attract voters who supported the earlier initiatives or have experienced the benefits.
6. **Competition:** With 50 projects in the running and a historical preference for certain types of projects (like green initiatives and infrastructure improvements), competition will be stiff.
7. **District's Project Count:** With 8 projects proposed in Psie Pole this year, the competition within the district itself is also notable.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Green Beltway of Wrocław - trees and vines in Wrocław's neighborhoods
- Cost: 100000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The project assumes the planting of trees in all housing estates along the Wrocław Motorway Bypass from Muchobor Wielki through Żerniki, Kuźniki, Pilczyce, Rędzin, Osobowice, Lipa Piotrowska, Widawa, Polanowice, and Pawłowice. The course of the AOW through residential areas and lands that could serve recreational functions (e.g., Pola Osobowickie) results in inconveniences for residents in the form of excessive noise throughout the day, a high amount of air pollution, and moreover, the concrete structure of acoustic screens has questionable aesthetic values. Many sections also lack acoustic insulation. Planting trees would to some extent reduce the unfavorable proximity of the AOW. Concrete acoustic screens could be covered with vines on the outer side.
Along the AOW, there are many places where trees can be planted and existing plantings supplemented (e.g., the area at Sułowska Street: Widawa plot, AR_16, 10/1, where only very small pines grow - adding tall deciduous trees would have a very positive impact on this place), strips along so-called technical roads and others. Near the AOW, there are municipal plots, e.g., in the Osobowice-Rędzin estate, and state-owned property in many places should not be an obstacle.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

3. **Theme Popularity**: Environmental and green space projects have historically performed well, such as ""Trees for Wrocław"" and ""Green cycling and walking ring road of Wrocław"".
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Similar projects with a focus on greenery and environmental improvement have received substantial votes, suggesting a strong community interest in such themes.
5. **Budget Allocation Dynamics**: Given the project's low cost, it stands a better chance of being funded after higher-cost projects have been considered, assuming it garners a moderate number of votes.
6. **Community Impact and Visibility**: The project covers a wide area and addresses common urban issues like noise and air pollution, which could appeal to a broad segment of voters.
7. **Historical Data and Trends**: Projects in the Krzyki district, especially those with environmental impact, have generally received good support, indicating potential success for this project.

In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of projects and voters across different districts.

**Analysis of the project ""Shelters for free-living cats"":**
1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The project's low cost (70,000 €) compared to other projects makes it more likely to be funded once it crosses a reasonable vote threshold.
2. **District Voting Patterns**: Psie Pole has historically lower average votes per project compared to other districts, which might reduce the competition for ""Shelters for free-living cats.""
3. **Project Theme**: Animal welfare projects can resonate well with the community, potentially attracting a dedicated voter base.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar small-scale community projects like ""Public toilet in Eastern Park"" and ""Benches at the Stops"" received moderate support, suggesting a potential for decent voting turnout.
5. **Overall Voter Engagement**: With 67103 voters and a trend of voting for multiple projects, even niche projects can secure a substantial number of votes.
6. **Project Visibility and Awareness**: The success will also depend on how well the project is marketed and the awareness among voters in the district.
7. **Historical Data and Ranking**: Projects in Psie Pole with costs around 100,000 € to 250,000 € received votes ranging from 831 to 1441. Given the lower cost and potentially high appeal of the project, it might perform slightly better.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Sequoia forest, fruit trees and shrubs
- Cost: 150000 €
- District: Stare Miasto
- Description: Justification
1. Few people know that once, powerful and ancient sequoias not only covered the area of the western coast of the USA but were also present throughout Europe. These are some of the oldest trees, as they can live for several thousand years and are certainly the largest of all. Few also know that in Poland, individual specimens grow, as well as in other European countries. The project assumes the initiation of restoring sequoia species in Poland, in Wrocław. The plan is to plant at least 50 of them in Wrocław's parks and forests. For them to function and produce new seedlings, the sequoias should be genetically diverse, originating from different regions/sources. To increase their chances of survival, they should be planted in at least 10 locations, with 5 genetically varied specimens each, along with a possible partial soil exchange for one that has the appropriate pH for them. Consultation with arborists will be useful here.
2. Utilitarian trees on wastelands will be publicly accessible. It takes some time for them to grow and bear fruit, but the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the next best time is now. Volunteers could be involved in the planting action to reduce the cost of this. Therefore, it might be possible to plant more of them eventually. It would be very important to plant a variety of species and seedlings. Plantings on wastelands would not increase the costs of greenery management, as such areas are not cared for as much as parks. Species and varieties should be chosen with special consideration for old Polish valuable and disappearing types, and the choice should be consulted with horticulture specialists.
3. Planting other trees in the city, in residential estates, in the vicinity of streets, squares, and plazas.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

**Analysis of the project ""Sequoia forest, fruit trees and shrubs"":**
1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The project cost (150,000 €) is relatively low compared to other projects, which could make it more likely to be funded after higher-cost projects have exhausted significant portions of the budget.
2. **District Voting Patterns**: Stare Miasto has historically had a lower average number of votes per project compared to other districts. However, the project's theme related to environmental sustainability could resonate well, given the current global emphasis on ecological issues.
3. **Similar Project Success**: Similar projects like ""Trees for Wrocław"" and ""Planting young trees in the area of Wrocław"" received a high number of votes, indicating a strong voter interest in greening and environmental projects.
4. **Project Appeal and Relevance**: The project's focus on planting sequoias and fruit trees could appeal to a wide demographic interested in long-term environmental sustainability and urban beautification.
5. **Visibility and Engagement**: The involvement of volunteers and the educational aspect of reintroducing ancient tree species could increase community engagement and visibility.
6. **Comparative Analysis**: Projects with a similar theme or lower costs in the same district have not reached the very top ranks, suggesting a competitive environment but also a consistent interest.
7. **Historical Data and Trends**: Analyzing past voting patterns, projects under 200,000 € in cost tend to receive moderate to high votes if they resonate well with the public sentiment or address a widely recognized need.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: City toilets in parks befitting Wrocław.
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Śródmieście
- Description: Justification
The initiative is a response to the problem of a lack of public toilets in the recreational spaces of the city. It involves the construction of 3 facilities in Wrocław parks, which are still not equipped with such amenities (Western Park, Grabiszyński Park, and Eastern Park). The toilet project was honored with the Grand Prix award at the KOŁO Bathroom 2015 competition.

The comprehensive program of the facility includes:
toilets: male, female, and for disabled persons
a room for mothers with children
a covered resting place (bench)
a drinking fountain and a place for animals to drink water
bicycle racks
a technical room
The cost of implementing one facility is about 330,000 PLN - an amount of 1 million PLN would allow for the construction of 3 such toilets.

The project will enrich the parks with a hygienic and functional space, giving park users greater freedom. The concept is universal and flexible, and its scope can be expanded to include additional parks.

Post-competition reviews:
“The winning project is a multifunctional concept, naturally integrated into the park space. The center of the composition is a tree that serves as a spatial and symbolic reference point for the project.”
“The principle adopted for the toilet complex is simple and modest, adapted to the necessary intimacy of using the space while ensuring the assigned cultural function and an impressive and elegant setting. Inexpensive and easy-to-maintain finishing materials will provide a good backdrop for the effectively proposed lighting, which will enrich the garden space in the evening and at night,” explains the jury's choice.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Greenery for Wrocław – pocket parks, plantings, green enclaves throughout the city!
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Psie Pole
- Description: Justification
In Wrocław, there has been a declarative change regarding greenery and environmental care in general. Unfortunately, changes do not occur too quickly on a daily basis. The city still lacks trees in many places, even though the existing underground networks do not interfere with plantings. During the construction of new buildings, there is no consideration for landscaping with anything other than low vegetation (shrubs or grasses), which results in empty spaces around them that heat up quickly, which is particularly troublesome in the summer.

Another problem is the neglected green spaces, and often those devoid of greenery. They could serve as meeting places for residents, make waiting for the tram more pleasant, or simply provide an opportunity to rest among vegetation. Unfortunately, worn-out lawns, lack of benches, or shade do not encourage such activities.

Another issue is the valuable green enclaves from a biodiversity perspective, which can be found especially in peripheral estates. It is worth preserving them, cleaning them up, and equipping them with infrastructure for animals, such as birdhouses or hedgehog houses.

Therefore, as part of the Greenery for Wrocław project, I propose creating pocket parks in various places around the city, additional tree plantings, and the protection of natural green enclaves.

The beneficiaries of the project will be all city residents living or working/studying near the selected locations. The implementation of the project will also positively affect the local climate and improve the aesthetics of public spaces.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

Start with a “Step Back”:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Greenery for Wrocław – pocket parks, plantings, green enclaves throughout the city!, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"**Step Back:**
In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, with each voter allowed to choose up to three projects. The total budget is allocated using a greedy algorithm, funding the most popular projects first until the budget is exhausted. Projects that are too costly relative to the remaining budget are skipped.

**Analysis of the project ""Greenery for Wrocław – pocket parks, plantings, green enclaves throughout the city!"":**
1. **Theme and Popularity**: The project's theme of enhancing green spaces aligns with previously popular projects like ""Trees for Wrocław"" which topped the list in 2016. This suggests a strong voter interest in green initiatives.
2. **District Voting Patterns**: Although Psie Pole had lower average votes per project compared to other districts, the environmental theme might still resonate well given the general popularity of green projects city-wide.
3. **Cost Consideration**: With a cost of 1,000,000 €, it matches the cost of several top-ranked projects from 2016, indicating that high-cost projects can indeed secure sufficient votes if the theme aligns well with voter interests.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in other districts have performed well, suggesting a city-wide appreciation for green projects. This could help in garnering votes across districts, not just in Psie Pole.
5. **Project Justification and Impact**: The detailed justification provided in the project description highlights a significant and widespread benefit, which could appeal to a broad demographic, potentially increasing its votes.
6. **Historical Data and Project Ranking**: Projects with a strong environmental focus and substantial community impact like ""Trees for Wrocław"" have historically ranked high. This project could follow a similar trajectory.
7. **Budget Constraints and Ranking**: Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it's feasible for this project to be funded if it ranks within the top few projects, as the budget has historically accommodated multiple million-euro projects.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Physicists' Boulevard - a scientific playground in the urban space (city-wide)
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Psie Pole
- Description: Justification
We propose the creation of an installation initially comprising several educational devices for children, youth, and adults related to physics on the J. Zwierzycki Boulevard adjacent to the building of the Faculty of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Wrocław. The devices are intended to be unique, hence they will not be numerous and will be custom-made or ordered from specialized companies. The project is designed to initiate a larger whole, which we aim to implement in the future (a science park).

In Wrocław, there is a lack of recreational areas with an educational function. Warsaw has its Copernicus Center, Wrocław has the Humanitarium - small and very distant from the center, only with a temporary exhibition installation in the building. In this context, our project will be unique in Wrocław and the surrounding area.

Additionally, the project assumes the creation of both the entire concept and the landscaping, which will allow for the installation of these devices on the (beautiful) boulevard in an aesthetic and coherent manner with the surroundings.

The details of the devices, their form, and physical content will be determined with the project leader in collaboration with the scientific staff of the Faculty of Physics and Astronomy during the project implementation stage.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Wrocław parks available to everyone.
- Cost: 200000 €
- District: Fabryczna
- Description: Justification
Parks are an integral part of the urban fabric. They enable pleasant and quick contact with nature. Due to their location and the infrastructure on their premises, many of them are also tourist attractions. To increase the accessibility of Wrocław's parks, the project proposes placing tactile maps at the entrances to selected parks. These plans will allow blind and visually impaired individuals to familiarize themselves with the topography of the areas depicted. They will learn the layout of paths and the location of interesting objects. Descriptions in black print will make the maps accessible to all visitors to Wrocław's parks and help them reach interesting places.
The tactile plans made of stainless steel with engraving will be resistant to weather conditions and potential vandalism attacks. Proposed locations:
1. Szczytnicki Park (entrance near Hala Stulecia tram stop), 2. Szczytnicki Park (entrance near Kochanowskiego tram stop), 3. Grabiszyński Park (entrance near Oporów tram stop), 4. Grabiszyński Park (entrance near Grabiszyńska Cmentarz II tram stop), 5. Western Park (entrance near DH Astra tram stop), 6. Western Park (entrance near Kolista tram stop), 7. Southern Park (near Orla tram stop), 8. Southern Park (entrance near Krzyki tram stop), 9. J. Słowacki Park (intersection of Słowackiego Avenue with Staromiejska Promenade), 10. Leśnicki Park (entrance near Świętojański Square).
Additionally, the project includes the creation of an educational trail in Szczytnicki Park, which will consist of 20 hardened thermoforms of leaves from trees most commonly found in Poland. Additionally, the embossed graphics will be supplemented with black print and Braille descriptions of each species.
The cost of purchasing one plan is approximately 13,000 PLN, and the cost of purchasing one thermoform is approximately 3,300 PLN.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Construction of the Wrocław handbike type integrative bicycle rental facility along with appropriate social and sanitary facilities.
- Cost: 600000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The project is designed for both disabled and able-bodied residents of Wrocław, as well as for guests and tourists.
Handbike bicycles allow for free and independent movement around the city despite any physical limitations. Thanks to the rental service, disabled individuals will be able to more fully enjoy the benefits of urban life, regardless of communication barriers. Creating such a place will allow for the integration of able-bodied and disabled people.
The project consists of two elements: the first is a bicycle shelter with handbike bicycles housed within; the second element is a social-sanitary building in a container (single-story) construction with an area of about 50 sqm. The building, intended for office or exhibition use and accessible throughout the year, will provide a space where cyclists can rest, share experiences, use a restroom adapted for the disabled, eat a meal, repair or adjust their bicycles. The building will be fully architecturally adapted to the needs of disabled persons.
The building, serving among other things as a community center, club, or simply a meeting place, will be equipped with the aforementioned toilet module, a kitchen sink with cabinetry, appliances such as a kettle, toaster, sandwich maker, microwave oven, tables, chairs, cabinets, bicycle tools, a lift, and a heating-cooling system.
We have several years of experience in operating and developing the Integrated Bicycle Rental www.roweryintegracyjne.pl.
The organization of activities undertaken as a result of the project will be handled by employees and volunteers of the DOBRY CEL foundation, which has supported socially excluded individuals since its inception.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Wrocław at your fingertips – tactile maps of selected areas of Wrocław.
- Cost: 130000 €
- District: Stare Miasto
- Description: Justification
The market and all places such as Ostrów Tumski, Centennial Hall with the Pergola are an undisputed tourist attraction of the city. But does everyone have equal access to them? Blind and visually impaired people have difficulty moving independently in unfamiliar terrain. Also, a person with a mobility disability should have the opportunity to enjoy the attractions offered by the city.

An ideal solution are tactile maps located in several important places, such as Ostrów Tumski, Centennial Hall with the Pergola, Słodowa Island, Piasek Island, the Market Square, National Forum of Music with Podwale, the Palace in Leśnica, the Old Town Park with the Puppet Theater, and Dunikowski Boulevard. These are tactile maps with a simplified representation of space and marking of the most important zones and points. They contain descriptions in Braille and help in optimally designing a route.

The maps allow for spatial orientation of blind and visually impaired people, as well as sighted individuals. They are made of durable material. The maps clearly represent the topography of the terrain for people with visual impairments, while allowing for independent movement around the city. Able-bodied people can use them like traditional maps. Thus, the maps will be attractive to tourists and residents.

We all want to explore and experience new places and attractions. We also have an internal need for social responsibility for those less fortunate. Let's do something together by combining all these needs and allow others to touch Wrocław. Let our city be adapted for the disabled. Let's show how it's done!

The cost of purchasing one plan is about 13,000 PLN.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.

Start with a “Step Back”:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Wrocław at your fingertips – tactile maps of selected areas of Wrocław., listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"**Step Back:**
In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, with each resident allowed to vote for up to three projects. The total budget is allocated using a greedy algorithm, funding the most popular projects first until the budget is exhausted. Projects that are too costly relative to the remaining budget are skipped. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to a wide audience, its visibility and perceived utility, and its cost relative to its perceived benefits.

**Analysis of ""Wrocław at your fingertips – tactile maps of selected areas of Wrocław"":**
1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The project's cost is relatively low (130,000 €) compared to other projects, which could make it more likely to be funded once higher-cost projects have exhausted significant portions of the budget.
2. **District Voting Patterns**: Stare Miasto has historically had projects that received a moderate number of votes. The average votes for projects in this district are lower than in some others, suggesting a mid-range popularity.
3. **Social Impact and Appeal**: The project addresses accessibility for the disabled, which is a significant social issue, potentially increasing its appeal to socially conscious voters.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in terms of social impact or infrastructure improvement have received a wide range of votes, but generally not the highest. This suggests a solid but not top-tier voting outcome.
5. **Project Visibility and Utility**: The project enhances tourist and local accessibility, which is a visible and practical benefit, likely increasing its appeal.
6. **Number of Projects in District**: With 11 projects proposed in Stare Miasto this year, the competition within the district is relatively high, which might dilute the votes among many projects.
7. **Historical Data and Trends**: Projects with a strong community or social component, like parks or accessibility improvements, tend to perform well but do not usually top the list unless they also have a broad or very enthusiastic target demographic.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Renovation of the Historic Fredruś Bus
- Cost: 430000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The Jelcz MEX convertible bus - Fredruś is listed in the register of monuments of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship. It was donated to the city in 1974 during the Wrocław Days. Since then, it has become a symbol of the city, transporting tourists and residents.
The name ""Fredruś"" was given in honor of Aleksander Fredro. However, since 2009 the bus has been immobilized and its prolonged exposure to the open air has severely deteriorated its technical condition, and now substantial financial resources are necessary to restore it to operation. This includes a complete reconstruction of the body, regeneration of details, and the vehicle's driving system, including the engine.
The project's goal is to enable residents, tourists, and guests to explore our city in an interesting way, and it should be noted that this bus has graced all parades and festivals of Wrocław. Let's renovate Fredruś and return it to the residents.

In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of projects across different districts which might affect local voter interest and turnout.

Analysis of the project ""Renovation of the Historic Fredruś Bus"":
1. The project cost (430,000 €) is moderate compared to other projects in Krzyki, making it more likely to be funded once it reaches a sufficient number of votes.
2. Historical and cultural projects like the Fredruś Bus renovation tend to have a dedicated but possibly smaller following, suggesting moderate popularity.
3. The project's previous iteration, ""Fredruś Vintage Bus Renovation,"" received 1924 votes and ranked 19th, indicating existing voter interest which could be built upon with effective campaigning.
4. Krzyki district generally shows higher voter engagement and support for projects, as seen with several high-ranking projects from previous years.
5. The project's relevance and appeal as a cultural symbol might attract both residents interested in cultural heritage and tourism, potentially increasing its vote count.
6. Competition within the district and the total number of projects (18 in Krzyki this year) could dilute votes among many options, affecting the final rank.
7. Given the historical significance and moderate cost, the project could perform better than in its previous iteration if awareness and sentiment towards preserving cultural heritage have increased.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: ""Konikowo"" - Construction of an original playground at the Wrocław Racecourse - Partynice
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Stare Miasto
- Description: Justification
Dear Residents of Wrocław, Dear Neighbors,
I represent the informal group ""I am from Ołtaszyn and the surrounding area – TOGETHER MORE VIBRANTLY"" (over 2200 members), who act together, help each other, and recommend family-friendly places. Very important spots on the map of Wrocław are playgrounds, and as we notice, there are still far too few of them.
Therefore, I am asking for support for our playground project on the premises of the Wrocław Racecourse – Partynice.
Why at Partynice?
- It is a public space (green, quiet, and safe area).
- It is easily accessible by public transport or car.
- There are horses here, loved by children.
- There is suitable infrastructure, toilets, a bar with great homemade food.
- The outdoor events organized here attract thousands of residents of Wrocław. As the Racecourse Management announces, during horse races, children will be taken care of by professional animators who will ensure fun and supervision.
- The surrounding playgrounds are mostly located in closed, constantly developing estates or are unfriendly (polluted, difficult to access, without shade, in a noisy place, by the street, etc.).
The proposed project will ensure safety and psychomotor development of children thanks to original and authorial equipment related to horses and equestrianism.
The Krzyki-Partynice neighborhood council has embraced our idea with enthusiasm.
Both the Racecourse Management and the residents care about making our area open to families and enabling spending time outdoors in a friendly environment.
We invite you to vote!!!
Come to Partynice!!

**INSTRUCTIONS DE SORTIE**  
Start with a “Step Back”:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project ""Konikowo"" - Construction of an original playground at the Wrocław Racecourse - Partynice, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"**Step Back:**
In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to a broad demographic, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of projects across different districts which might affect local voter interest and turnout.

**Analysis of ""Konikowo"" - Construction of an original playground at the Wrocław Racecourse - Partynice:**
1. **District Voting History:** Projects in Stare Miasto have historically received a moderate number of votes, with the highest in recent times being 3632 votes.
2. **Project Cost:** At 1,000,000 €, this project is on the expensive side, which might limit its funding chances if the budget becomes constrained.
3. **Theme and Appeal:** Playgrounds generally have broad appeal, especially in family-centric communities. The unique thematic focus on equestrian-related play equipment could enhance its appeal.
4. **Community Support:** The project is backed by a significant local group, which could help in mobilizing votes.
5. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects like playgrounds and recreational spaces have received a decent number of votes, suggesting a consistent interest in such initiatives.
6. **Visibility and Accessibility:** The location at a popular racecourse, which is a well-known public space, could increase the project's visibility and, by extension, its votes.
7. **Competition within District:** With 11 projects proposed in Stare Miasto this year, the competition might dilute the votes, but strong community backing and unique appeal could counterbalance this effect.

Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to a broad audience, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of projects across different districts which might affect local voter interest and turnout.

**Analysis of the Project ""Grabiszyński Park - safe access!"":**
1. **District Voting History**: Stare Miasto has historically had a moderate voting turnout compared to other districts, with projects receiving a wide range of votes.
2. **Project Cost**: At 1,000,000 €, the project is expensive, which means it needs a high number of votes to justify its cost under the greedy algorithm.
3. **Similar Projects**: Similar infrastructure projects in the district have had mixed results, suggesting variability in voter interest for such projects.
4. **Project Appeal**: The project focuses on safety and accessibility, which are generally popular themes, potentially increasing its appeal.
5. **Competition**: With 11 projects proposed in Stare Miasto this year, competition could dilute the vote unless this project distinctly stands out.
6. **Historical Data**: Projects in Stare Miasto like ""Neptune's Fountain at Nowy Targ Square"" received 3632 votes and ranked 9th, indicating that highly appealing projects can indeed gather significant support.
7. **Project Relevance**: The project's focus on improving access to a popular park could resonate well with local residents, potentially driving higher voter turnout for this specific project.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Revitalization of Ruska Street
- Cost: 750000 €
- District: Psie Pole
- Description: Justification
The aim of the project is the renovation of Ruska Street (section from Kazimierza Wielkiego to Solny Square), taking into account the high pedestrian traffic in this area - transforming it into a pedestrian route, accessible to bicycles. The transformation seen on Kuźnicza and Oławska Streets could be replicated here, with even greater success anticipated.

Ruska Street needs renovation. It is a route with great potential - it connects a transit hub with the Market Square, and there is room for more attractive services on the ground floors of buildings. Moreover, several underground car parks have been established in the area (Times office building, NFM). Ruska should feature trees and benches, and a suggested bicycle lane could be marked (e.g., with a different shade of pavement).

During the renovation, only pedestrian-friendly surfaces should be used (as seen on Kuźnicza Street, the residents of Wrocław do not accept cobblestones).
*In case the renovation turns out to cost more than 1 million PLN, the first phase should be carried out, e.g., revitalization of part of the indicated street section.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

Analysis of the project ""Revitalization of Ruska Street"":
1. The project cost (750,000 €) is moderate and aligns with other similar projects in terms of funding requirements, making it a feasible candidate for selection within the budget constraints.
2. The district, Psie Pole, has historically lower average votes per project compared to other districts, which might affect the project's ability to garner a high number of votes.
3. Similar projects in the district and city have received a moderate number of votes, suggesting a consistent but not overwhelming interest in street renovations.
4. The project's focus on enhancing pedestrian and bicycle access could appeal to environmentally conscious voters and those interested in urban improvements, potentially increasing its vote count.
5. The project's description highlights a significant need and potential benefit to the community, which could enhance voter interest.
6. Given the historical data, projects in Psie Pole that are similarly priced tend to rank in the middle to lower end of the funded projects.
7. The project's success might also depend on the competition from other projects in the same district and citywide, especially those with similar themes or more compelling benefits.

Start with a “Step Back”:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Kępa Mieszczańska – a pocket park with a street workout station near Dmowski Bridge in Wrocław., listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"**Step Back:**
In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and perceived utility, the cost of the project relative to its benefits, and the distribution of projects across different districts which might affect local voter interest and turnout.

**Analysis of the Project ""Kępa Mieszczańska – a pocket park with a street workout station near Dmowski Bridge in Wrocław"":**
1. **District Voting History:** Projects in Psie Pole have historically received moderate interest compared to other districts, with an average vote count lower than the city's most active districts.
2. **Project Cost:** At 750,000 €, the project's cost is substantial but not the highest, making it a feasible choice under the budget cap if it garners enough votes.
3. **Similar Projects:** Similar projects in terms of theme and district have received a decent number of votes, suggesting a consistent interest in recreational and community-focused improvements.
4. **Project Appeal:** The project offers multiple amenities, which could appeal to a broad demographic, potentially increasing its vote count.
5. **Competition:** With 50 projects in the running this year and 8 in the same district, the competition level is significant, which might dilute the votes across multiple projects.
6. **Historical Data:** Projects with similar themes and costs in other districts have ranked well but not always in the top spots unless they received exceptionally high votes.
7. **Budget Allocation Dynamics:** Given the greedy algorithm and the project's mid-range cost, if it does not rank among the top initially, it might still be funded after higher-cost projects are skipped due to budget constraints.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Urban Green Islands
- Cost: 250000 €
- District: Stare Miasto
- Description: Justification
This year, smog has made its presence felt by all residents of Wrocław. Studies have shown that we could breathe clean air for only a few days! The data is alarming. Meanwhile, during the summer, so-called urban heat islands form in our area, causing an artificial increase in temperature compared to the surrounding areas. How can we deal with the negative effects of urbanization? What can be done to make life easier for us, the residents of Wrocław? How can we reduce these negative effects that impact our health? We propose a globally tested system for reducing the negative effects of smog and urban heat islands, which involves installing specialized panels planted with moss and capable of supporting other plants. This project fits perfectly into the concept of Green Wrocław. It is also an excellent idea for originally enhancing urban space. The main function of the panels will be the reduction of air pollution – plants, especially mosses, have the ability to simultaneously absorb many different pollutants from the air, including polluting gases (NOX, CO2, CO, and O3) and suspended particulates. Moss provides an excellent substrate and is resistant to low temperatures. On hot days, the panels lower the temperature through water evaporation. The panels also contribute to noise reduction. The panels have a proper irrigation system that keeps the plants alive, moisturizes the air around the installation, and reduces air dustiness. Mosses are excellent reservoirs of rainwater, thus they are helpful during heavy downpours. The panels have other advantages too - greenery improves mood and reduces stress. Wrocław would be the first city in Poland to boast such a modern and eco-friendly solution.

- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.

Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, relevance to community needs, cost, and the voting history and dynamics of the district it is proposed in.

**Analysis of the Project ""Urban Green Islands"":**
1. **District Voting History:** Stare Miasto has historically had lower average votes per project compared to other districts like Krzyki and Fabryczna. This might affect the visibility and voting turnout for projects in this district.
2. **Project Cost:** At 250,000 €, the project is relatively affordable, which could allow it to be funded even if it doesn't secure a top position, as seen with other similarly priced projects in previous years.
3. **Environmental Appeal:** Given the increasing awareness and concern about environmental issues such as smog and urban heat islands, this project could resonate well with voters, similar to other successful green projects.
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Projects with environmental themes like ""Trees for Wrocław"" and ""Planting young trees in the area of Wrocław"" have performed exceptionally well, suggesting a strong voter base for green initiatives.
5. **Project Innovation and Relevance:** The innovative approach using moss panels could attract attention due to its novelty and direct addressal of current environmental issues faced by the city.
6. **Similar Project Outcomes:** Similar projects in terms of theme and district have garnered a moderate to high number of votes, suggesting a potentially strong performance.
7. **Budget Allocation Dynamics:** Given its lower cost, even if several higher-cost projects get prioritized, this project still stands a good chance of being funded within the available budget.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Toilets in Wrocław parks and recreational areas.
- Cost: 900000 €
- District: Śródmieście
- Description: Justification
In parks and green areas in Wrocław, there is a lack of toilets, which makes it difficult to use them for recreational purposes for an extended period.
We propose the installation of toilets (technology optional, probably the best would be self-cleaning and/or vandalism-resistant).
We propose the following locations:
1) Szczytnicki Park
2) Eastern Park
3) Southern Park
4) Millennium Park
5) Western Park
6) Karłowice (Kasprowicz Park or Karłowicka Glade or Brodzik)
The details of the placement will be determined with the project leader. In case any of the aforementioned parks already has a toilet at the time of the project's win, together with UMW, we will choose another location.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

**INSTRUCTIONS DE SORTIE**  
Start with a “Step Back”:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Toilets in Wrocław parks and recreational areas., listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"Step Back:
In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, with each resident allowed to vote for up to three projects. The total budget is allocated using a greedy algorithm, funding the most popular projects first until the budget is exhausted. Projects that are too costly relative to the remaining budget are skipped. The success of a project in this system is influenced by its appeal to voters, its visibility, its cost, and its alignment with the needs and preferences of the local community.

Analysis of ""Toilets in Wrocław parks and recreational areas"":
1. The project addresses a clear need for public amenities in parks, which is likely to resonate with many voters who use these recreational areas.
2. The cost of the project (900,000 €) is significant but not the highest among proposed projects, making it feasible within the budget constraints if it garners enough support.
3. Projects in the Śródmieście district have historically received a moderate number of votes, with the highest in 2016 being 4799 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of engagement from the district's residents.
4. Similar projects focusing on park improvements or amenities (like playgrounds or park revitalizations) have received a decent number of votes, indicating a community interest in enhancing public spaces.
5. The project's cost is lower than some other high-cost projects in the same district, which might make it more likely to be funded after higher-voted but more expensive projects are considered.
6. Given the average and range of votes for similar projects, it is likely to receive a substantial number of votes but may not be the top-voted project.
7. The project's utility and broad appeal (everyone needs toilets) could push it into the top 10, but competition with other appealing projects might prevent it from reaching the top 5.

In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to a broad demographic, its visibility and utility, the cost relative to the budget, and the voting history and project saturation within its district.

**Analysis of the Project ""Large outdoor chess in the center of Wrocław"":**
1. **District Voting History:** Stare Miasto has a mixed record, with projects like Neptune's Fountain receiving high votes, but others like Raising the platforms at Reagan Roundabout receiving relatively few. The average votes for projects in this district are lower compared to districts like Krzyki.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** The project's cost (250,000 €) is moderate and aligns with other similarly priced projects that received a moderate number of votes, such as the Nextbike city bike stations.
3. **Similar Project Comparison:** A similar project, ""Outdoor chess with large-scale pieces in the city center"" in Fabryczna, received only 619 votes. This suggests a potentially limited appeal.
4. **Project Appeal and Utility:** While culturally enriching, the project may not appeal broadly across demographics compared to more utilitarian projects.
5. **Competition:** With 11 projects in Stare Miasto this year, the competition is stiff, possibly diluting the vote share.
6. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it is feasible to be funded if it garners enough votes, but its appeal might limit its voting potential.
7. **Historical Data and Trends:** Projects in Stare Miasto that were funded had either a high utility or a very distinctive appeal, which might not be strongly mirrored by the chess project.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Pedestrian and bicycle paths along Opatowicka Street.
- Cost: 500000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
Along Opatowicka Street, there are several sections of flood embankments, on top of which are hardened paths. They are perfect for walks, bike rides, and running. Between the ""embanked"" sections, there are no paths separated from the road, allowing for the safe movement of pedestrians, runners, and cyclists. This has been particularly noticeable since the road section between the eastern bypass of Wrocław and Trestno was renovated, which has led to a significant increase in the volume of cars driving on Opatowicka Street. The completed paths would connect the entire loop: the footbridge near the zoo (from the Oder side), embankments along Sępolno, Biskupin, Bartoszewicz, Opatowicka weir, Opatowicka Island, Opatowicka lock, Opatowicka Street, Międzyrzecka Street.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Safer at the intersection of Sobieski Avenue and Wilanowska Street
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The project aims to improve safety at the exit from al. Sobieskiego onto Zakrzów. This location witnesses numerous accidents (including fatal ones), primarily caused by vehicles from Mirków rear-ending vehicles turning left into ul. Wilanowska. The occurrence of dangerous situations is contributed to by excessive vehicle speeds and long waiting times for turning towards Zakrzów during afternoon hours.

Additionally, there is frequent violation of the no-left-turn rule from ul. Wilanowska towards the city boundary. Often, this maneuver is performed by trucks, resulting in the trailer blocking the road towards the city center.

The forced right of way by vehicles exiting the parking lots on ul. Wilanowska also plays a significant role. This is due to the unintuitive signage and unclear geometry of this part of the intersection.

Since this is the most frequented entrance to our estate and is traversed by bus line 150, the current state of safety at this location is unacceptable to the residents of Zakrzów.

The project scope includes:
- drafting a traffic organization plan that will facilitate the left turn from al. Sobieskiego into ul. Wilanowska, increase the throughput of the left turn, reduce the speed of vehicles heading towards the city center, and prevent exits from ul. Wilanowska towards Mirków
- construction works (introduction of new traffic organization elements and road safety devices, and possible adjustment of the intersection geometry)
- potential installation of speed control devices

We do not provide specific solutions (construction of traffic lights, installation of vibratory lines on the road, installation of speed cameras, etc.), as we believe that the effectiveness of the measures applied is guaranteed only by an analysis of the problem conducted during the project drafting stage.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: On foot from Brochów - completion of the missing sidewalk on I. Mościckiego, Gazowa, and Karwińska Streets (mainly concerns the viaduct over the tracks connecting these three streets)
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
From Brochów, it is impossible to leave on foot without walking the streets - there are no sidewalks. Indeed, some time ago, I. Mościckiego Street was widened with a gravel strip, which was probably meant to substitute for a sidewalk but only up to the railway viaduct on Wiaduktowa Street. The aim of the project is to construct safe sidewalks, enabling the residents of Brochów to leave the estate without having to use public transport or cars. Very often, children returning from school use the viaduct connecting I. Mościckiego Street with Gazowa and Karwińska Streets, which is very dangerous because the traffic there is really heavy, and there is virtually no shoulder, while crossing with a child in a stroller is impossible. The project will also include additional lighting over these streets, especially over the pedestrian crossing on I. Mościckiego Street near the bus stops, before the railway viaduct (from the city center side). When driving there at night, it is very difficult to see anyone on these strips because just before them is the last street lamp, and before the driver's eyes adjust to the darkness, they are already past the pedestrian crossings. An accident in this place is easily conceivable.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Honey Meadows in Wrocław
- Cost: 100000 €
- District: Psie Pole
- Description: Justification
The aim of the project is to create an attractive urban space, improve plant diversity, and protect beneficial pollinating insects.
The project concerns four locations: the main one at pl. Wróblewskiego and three smaller ones (Wyspa Słodowa, Pomorska, Gajowicka), where we plan to create an unusual, green enclave.
As part of the development of areas with a total area of almost 12,000 m2, it is planned to plant suitable flowering vegetation, whose blooming period would allow for constant access to pollination for insects and would make this place more attractive during the spring-summer and autumn periods (shrubs are also planned, which diversify the terrain especially in winter). This would allow for the preservation of greenery diversity, and would initiate the protection of valuable pollinating insects in urban spaces, including honey bees, which are dying at an alarming rate, leading to a lack of plant and product diversity.
In developing the project, I collaborated with students from the Student Scientific Circle of Beekeepers ""Apis"" at the University of Environmental and Life Sciences in Wrocław. Their expert knowledge of plants and insects would help in creating honey meadows in Wrocław. In conclusion, I would like to add that the idea is in line with Wrocław's efforts to win the title of European Green Capital in 2019.

- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.

In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project, and the distribution of votes among competing projects within the same district and across the city.

**Analysis of the project Honey Meadows in Wrocław:**
1. **Cost Efficiency**: At 100,000 €, Honey Meadows is one of the less expensive projects, which could allow it to be easily funded within the remaining budget after higher-cost projects are considered.
2. **District Voting Patterns**: In Psie Pole, projects have historically received a moderate number of votes, with the highest in 2016 being around 3000 votes. This suggests a mid-range popularity for projects in this district.
3. **Environmental Appeal**: The project's focus on biodiversity and urban green spaces aligns with contemporary urban ecological trends, which could attract a significant number of votes from environmentally conscious residents.
4. **Collaboration and Educational Aspect**: The involvement of university students and the educational aspect of promoting biodiversity and protecting pollinators add a community and educational value that might appeal to voters.
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Similar projects like ""Planting young trees in the area of Wrocław"" in a different district received over 5000 votes. Although district dynamics differ, this indicates potential voter interest in green projects.
6. **Visibility and Scope**: The project spans multiple locations, potentially increasing its visibility and appeal across a broader segment of the city's population.
7. **Budget Context**: Given the total budget and the project's low cost, it's likely to be funded after more expensive projects are considered, assuming it garners enough votes.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Wrocław Sports Arena - Zone A
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The project envisages the creation of Zone A of the Wrocław Sports Arena located in Zakrzów.
The lack of access to diverse and universally accessible sports and recreational facilities affects a very large number of Wrocław residents. The existing places created for this purpose are overcrowded and insufficiently adapted to the expectations of our city's residents. The deficit of such infrastructure results in a significant portion of Wrocław residents giving up on physical activity. The primary goal of the Sports Arena is to fill the gap in the map of Wrocław's sports and recreational infrastructure by creating a sports center in the northeast part of the city. The layout and selection of facilities for new disciplines at the Sports Arena will make it a unique meeting place for families from all over Wrocław. The project will include:
- a beach volleyball court
- Pumptrack Entry - a track designed for beginner and intermediate cyclists. It will be built using modular technology, so that it can be expanded or reshaped in the future
- a Padel court. Padel is a combination of Squash and Tennis, an ideal family sport with a recreational character. It is not a technical sport, which allows beginner players to quickly reach a level that enables comfortable play
- Expansion of the baseball field with a concrete grandstand set behind the backstop on the left side. This investment will enhance the entire complex and emphasize its unique character.
The project has been consulted with the residents of Wrocław. It meets the needs for activating the society associated with actively spending free time outdoors. Wrocław Sports Arena will also be a venue for national sports events, which will enhance the attractiveness of the sports offer for the city's residents.

In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Projects are prioritized by vote count, and those with higher costs may be skipped if insufficient funds remain. The district, project cost, and thematic appeal (such as sports, green spaces, or infrastructure) significantly influence voter preference and project success.

**Analysis of Wrocław Sports Arena - Zone A:**
1. **District Voting Patterns**: Krzyki is a competitive district with historically high voter turnout and engagement, often favoring large-scale and community-centric projects.
2. **Project Cost and Budget Impact**: The project cost of 1,000,000 € is substantial, which means it needs a high vote count to secure funding, considering the total budget and competition.
3. **Theme and Community Impact**: Sports and recreational facilities generally receive good support, as seen with similar past projects in Krzyki and other districts.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects like the Playground for Older Children and the Green cycling and walking ring road received 6663 and 12348 votes respectively, indicating strong community interest in substantial recreational developments.
5. **Project Uniqueness and Appeal**: The project offers diverse recreational facilities, which might attract a broad demographic, potentially increasing its vote count.
6. **Historical Data and Trends**: Projects in Krzyki with costs around 1,000,000 € have ranked well if they garnered around 6000-12000 votes.
7. **Community Consultation and Engagement**: The project's consultation with residents could enhance its appeal, translating into higher votes if effectively communicated.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Tuscany in Wrocław: flower pots around the Wrocław Market Square.
- Cost: 350000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The aim of the project is to beautify the streets around the Wrocław Market Square by placing 100 decorative, ceramic planters with blooming flowers and 50 hanging flower baskets in the area around the Wrocław Market Square. The Old Town in Wrocław suffers from a lack of greenery, and the floral arrangements in the planters would become an impressive decoration, highlighting the beauty of the historic townhouses and contributing to the promotion of the city. The planters should be durable against temperature changes, heavy and stable, and resistant to vandalism (easy to clean).

**Analysis of the Project ""Green cycling and walking ring road of Wrocław; STAGE II"":**
1. **Previous Success**: The first stage of this project was the second most-voted project in 2016, indicating strong public support for cycling and walking infrastructure.
2. **High Cost**: The project cost is 1,000,000 €, which is significant but consistent with other top projects from 2016.
3. **District Voting Patterns**: Stare Miasto had lower average votes per project compared to other districts like Krzyki and Fabryczna, which might affect the total votes this project can gather.
4. **Theme Popularity**: Projects related to cycling, greenery, and pedestrian pathways have historically performed well, suggesting a favorable reception.
5. **Social Media Engagement**: The project promotes engagement through a Facebook page, potentially increasing its visibility and voter support.
6. **Comparative Analysis**: Similar projects in other districts received substantial votes, but none in Stare Miasto reached the top 10 in 2016, which might indicate a challenge for this project to break into the top ranks.
7. **Budget Constraints**: Given the project's high cost, its funding will depend on not exceeding the budget cap after higher-ranked projects are considered.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Network of parks in Wrocław - Psie Pole - Zawidawie 1
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Fabryczna
- Description: Justification
The aim of the project is to create two green areas in the Psie Pole-Zawidawie district - the development of a neglected plot in the LZN area located between Gorlicka Street and Kiełczowska Street, and a recreational area on Zakrzowie on the bank of the Dobra River. Connecting areas located on both sides of Sobieski Avenue aims to activate residents of the entire estate around a common project within the framework of WBO 2017.
The first area in this project is a neglected green plot stretching between the estate at Miłostowska Street, LZN, and the estate at Gorlicka Street. An illuminated bicycle path should be led along its inner or outer edge. In the rows of newly planted trees, there will be a place for recreation and play for the youngest children. It is also important to develop the ""wedge"" from Kiełczowska Street to the end of the LZN fence. This place is easily accessible by a sidewalk built as part of WBO. The reported project also includes the development of the space between the sidewalk and the LZN fence. Along the length of the concrete fence, paving with blocks, and along the length of the metal fence and ""island,"" appropriately selected greenery.
The second location of this project is the area on Zakrzowie, along the bank of the Dobra – from Zakrzowski Bridge to the unpaved road leading to Zakrzów Stadium. An ideal place for a proper path and family relaxation time, e.g., picnics. It is necessary to tidy up the area, designate avenues, build a shelter/s, two or three fire pits, and benches around them.
The beneficiaries will be residents of the surrounding estates, but through the development of a network park, in the future, all Wrocław residents as well.
The project was created as a result of the work of the WBO 2017 Working Group and meetings within the Civic Laboratory in Zawidawie in 2017.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.

In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to a broad demographic, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of projects across different districts which might affect local voter interest and turnout.

Analysis of the project ""Network of parks in Wrocław - Psie Pole - Zawidawie 1"":
1. The project is located in the Fabryczna district, which historically receives a high average number of votes per project, indicating active voter participation.
2. The cost of the project is 1,000,000 €, aligning with several other high-ranking projects from previous years, suggesting that voters are willing to support higher-cost projects if they see substantial community benefits.
3. Similar projects in terms of theme (green spaces and recreational areas) have performed variably, but generally well, such as ""Trees for Wrocław"" and ""Unity Park – urban recreation"".
4. The project aims to serve a broad demographic by enhancing recreational and green spaces, which could increase its appeal.
5. The description indicates a well-thought-out plan developed through community engagement, which might increase voter support.
6. Competition within the district and the total number of projects proposed city-wide (50 projects) will influence the ranking, but given the historical data, a well-supported green project in Fabryczna has a strong chance of performing well.
7. The project's comprehensive nature and focus on enhancing community spaces align with successful themes from previous elections.

In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, with each voter allowed to choose up to three projects. The total budget is allocated using a greedy algorithm, funding the most popular projects first until the budget is exhausted. Projects that are too costly relative to the remaining budget are skipped.

**Analysis of Bike Wrocław 2017:**
1. **District Voting Patterns**: Stare Miasto had a lower average vote count in 2016 compared to other districts, suggesting a potentially lower voter turnout or engagement in this district.
2. **Project Cost and Budget Impact**: The project cost of 1,000,000 € is significant, which means it needs a high vote count to secure funding, considering the greedy algorithm used.
3. **Theme Popularity**: Similar projects related to cycling infrastructure in other districts received a substantial number of votes, indicating a general popularity for bike-friendly initiatives.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: The ""Green cycling and walking ring road of Wrocław"" in Krzyki received 12,348 votes, suggesting high potential for similar projects. However, district-specific dynamics might alter outcomes.
5. **Historical Data from Stare Miasto**: The most voted project in Stare Miasto in 2016 was ""Neptune's Fountain at Nowy Targ Square"" with 3,632 votes, setting a comparative benchmark.
6. **Project Specifics and Appeal**: The detailed and extensive coverage of the project across multiple streets may appeal to a broad audience, potentially increasing its vote count.
7. **Economic and Social Impact**: Enhancing cycling infrastructure could be seen as contributing to environmental sustainability and public health, aligning with popular urban development goals.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Bike and stroller ramp at the exit from Sopocka Street to the Odra River Embankments
- Cost: 50000 €
- District: Fabryczna
- Description: Justification
The embankments along the Oder, especially the section between the Warsaw Bridges and the Szczytnicki Bridge after the completed revitalization, have become a wonderful place for walks and bike rides.
The aim of the project is to construct a ramp from Sopocka Street, which will allow free access to the cycling and walking paths for residents.
Currently, accessing the cycling and walking paths on the embankments from Sopocka Street is difficult for cyclists, disabled people, and mothers with children due to the lack of a convenient ramp: there are only steep and difficult-to-climb stairs.
Moreover, this passage is very frequently used not only by local residents but also by visitors to the St. Lawrence Cemetery and those traveling to the nearby allotment gardens on Bujwida Street.
Furthermore, the project aligns with the concept of promoting cycling in Wrocław and restoring the river to the city, and is a natural continuation of the recently completed construction of a bicycle passage under the Szczytnicki Bridge.

- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.

**Analysis of the Project ""Bike and stroller ramp at the exit from Sopocka Street to the Odra River Embankments"":**
1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The project's low cost (50,000 €) compared to other projects makes it a financially attractive option, potentially allowing it to be funded even if it doesn't receive the highest number of votes.
2. **District Voting Patterns**: Fabryczna has historically supported projects with a focus on outdoor and community enhancements, as seen with the high votes for ""Trees for Wrocław"" and ""Unity Park"".
3. **Theme Relevance**: The project aligns with the popular themes of enhancing mobility and accessibility, similar to other successful projects like bike routes and park enhancements.
4. **Utility and Appeal**: The project addresses a clear need for better accessibility, likely appealing to a broad demographic including cyclists, parents with strollers, and disabled individuals.
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Similar projects in terms of theme and utility (like bicycle routes and park improvements) have garnered significant support, suggesting a favorable reception.
6. **Visibility and Awareness**: The project's success will depend on effective campaigning to ensure it is as visible as projects in previous years that received high votes.
7. **Competition**: With 50 projects in the running and 6 in the same district, the competition could be stiff, but the project's distinct utility and low cost provide a competitive edge.

In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, with each voter allowed to vote for up to three projects. The total budget is allocated using a greedy algorithm, funding projects in descending order of votes until the budget is exhausted. Projects that are too costly relative to the remaining budget are skipped. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and perceived utility, cost, and the distribution of projects across different city districts.

**Analysis of the Project ""Renovation of unsightly railway viaducts"":**
1. **District Voting Patterns:** The project is in the Krzyki district, which historically receives a high average number of votes per project, indicating active voter participation.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** At 250,000 €, the project is relatively inexpensive compared to other projects in the same district, which could allow it to be funded even if it doesn't top the vote count.
3. **Thematic Appeal:** Similar projects with a focus on aesthetic and environmental improvements (like ""Trees for Wrocław"") have performed well, suggesting a positive reception for beautification projects.
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Projects with similar themes and costs in the district, such as ""Urban Green Islands"" (cost: 250,000 €, 990 votes), provide a baseline for estimating votes.
5. **Visibility and Impact:** The project's focus on improving daily visuals for many residents could enhance its appeal, potentially increasing voter support beyond similar past projects.
6. **Economic Context:** Given the modest cost, the project is less likely to be skipped due to budget constraints, increasing its chances of being funded.
7. **Historical Data:** The top projects in Krzyki district often exceed 3000 votes, and while beautification projects are popular, they typically receive fewer votes than large-scale infrastructure projects.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Sporty Amber
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
In executing the project for the construction of a multifunctional sports field from WBO 2014, we noticed an increase in the sporting potential among the residents of this area; there is hardly an hour when the field built in 2015 is free. Therefore, we decided to expand the sports facilities for the residents of this area by applying for:
a) the construction of a multifunctional field with lines for playing handball, two basketball courts, and a volleyball court at the intersection of Jantarowa and Zaporoska streets on the current premises of LO VIII. The field should have a polyurethane surface and be surrounded by ball catchers.
b) the replacement of the fence along the current Liceum nr VIII and Gimnazjum nr 30, which will become one institution in the future, along with the placement of gates in locations where residents already cross the fence, facilitating entry for all residents.
c) along the inner part of the fence, we propose planting shrubs to reduce the number of people crossing the fences in the future.
d) on the side of Krucza Street, near the field built in 2015, we propose the construction of an outdoor gym adapted for the needs of adults and the elderly.
e) the installation of lighting for sports fields using both solar technology and an SMS-based lighting activation system.
Additionally, we propose the renovation of the sidewalk along Jantarowa Street.
The implementation of the project will increase the attractiveness of the sports base of the estate, enhance the aesthetics of the estate by increasing the existing greenery, and improve the safety of pedestrians moving along Jantarowa.

5. The project's comprehensive nature and the inclusion of features like solar lighting and an SMS-based lighting system could be seen as innovative, potentially attracting more votes.
6. Competition within the district is strong with 18 projects proposed; however, the multifunctional aspect of this project might give it an edge over more singularly focused initiatives.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Boarding at level - construction of Górnicki's Viennese stops
- Cost: 500000 €
- District: Śródmieście
- Description: Justification
Vienna-style stops facilitate boarding for the elderly, disabled, and parents with strollers, and ensure that drivers adhere to speed limits. This solution is increasingly being implemented in the city, including on Hubskiej, Glinianej, Trzebnickiej, and Szczytnickiej streets. The Kleczkowska stop is used by many clients of the nearby Social Insurance Institution (ZUS)—the elderly and disabled, and the elevated entrance greatly facilitates their use of public transport. The Górnickiego stop is located on the busy Sienkiewicza street. Constructing a boarding island will also improve passenger safety.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its cost relative to the total budget, and its district's voting history and population engagement.

**Analysis of the project Modernization of DRZEWIECKIEGO Street:**
1. **District Voting History**: Krzyki district has historically received a high average number of votes per project, indicating strong voter engagement and competition.
2. **Project Cost**: At 1,000,000 €, the project is expensive, which means it needs a significant number of votes to justify its cost against the budget cap.
3. **Similar Projects**: Similar infrastructure projects in Krzyki, like the Parking at ""Dobrzyńska"" and the extension of the left-turn lane, received substantial votes (6383 and 2901 respectively), suggesting a good voter base for infrastructure improvements.
4. **Project Theme**: Infrastructure projects, especially those improving traffic and pedestrian safety, tend to resonate well with urban voters, potentially increasing voter interest.
5. **Competition**: With 18 projects in Krzyki this year, the competition is stiff, which might split votes among several strong contenders.
6. **Historical Top Projects**: Projects costing around 1,000,000 € in Krzyki have historically ranked in the top 10 if they garnered around 3000 to 7000 votes.
7. **Budget Constraints**: Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it needs to be among the top vote-getters to be funded.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Green running-walking-cycling trail from Ołtaszyn to the center (with modifications)
- Cost: 750000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
I propose several modifications (mainly cost-reducing) to this project so that it is feasible and fits within the planned budget:
1. The route passes through several districts (originally 3) and for this reason, I classify this project as city-wide with a higher budget.
2. Shortening the route - running from the renovated Parafialna Street through Orawska and Spiska to Skowroni Park. Only if further financing is obtained or larger funds are utilized, do I propose extending it through Spiska Street to the Aquapark or further.
3. Replacing the asphalt surface with a smooth, compacted gravel surface. This change:
a) lowers costs
b) is healthier and more comfortable for runners and equivalent for cyclists
c) allows car drivers access to allotment gardens while simultaneously reducing the speed of access compared to an asphalt road, thereby improving the safety of pedestrians, runners, and cyclists.
d) maintains the recreational character of the path in terms of physical activity for pedestrians, runners, and cyclists without turning it into an asphalt, congested access road and a shortcut and alternative route for cars for the congested Grota-Roweckiego Street.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, the cost, and its relevance to a broad or specific segment of the community. Projects that address widespread community needs or have a strong emotional or practical appeal tend to gather more votes.

3. **Theme and Relevance:** The project focuses on green, recreational infrastructure, which aligns with popular themes from previous elections (e.g., the Green cycling and walking ring road).
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Similar projects like the Green cycling and walking ring road received a high number of votes (12,348 votes), suggesting a strong voter interest in this type of project.
5. **Innovative and Cost-Effective Modifications:** The proposal includes cost-reducing modifications and emphasizes health and safety, which could appeal to a broader audience, potentially increasing its vote count.
6. **Project Visibility and Appeal:** Assuming effective communication and community engagement, the project's appeal as a multi-use, environmentally friendly initiative could drive higher voter turnout and support.
7. **Competition:** With 18 projects in the district, the competition is stiff, but the project's broad appeal and practical benefits give it a competitive edge.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Green Promenade through Krzyki Stage I
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The project aims to restore the historical urban layout by revalorizing the promenade stretching from the intersection of Zaporoska and Grabiszyńska streets, crowned with the historic water tower at Aleja Wiśniowa. We propose to reclaim the aesthetic values of the original green artery concept, combined with the communication needs of this part of the district. The street, outlined in the late 19th century, is an example of a beautiful visual axis dominated by the water tower from 1904, a monument to good urban planning, additionally serving as a green corridor of the area. With minimal resources, we can restore the luster of the former promenade while organizing and improving pedestrian, vehicular, and bicycle traffic on this section. The work performed could potentially mark the beginning of further changes towards Grabiszyńska Street. The primary task of the project is to improve the aesthetics of the area, the quality of life of the residents, and to connect a convenient pedestrian and bicycle route along the entire section of the green artery from landmarks such as the water tower and the Jewish Hospital, now housing the Railway Hospital, further to the Roman Catholic Parish of St. Augustine, Hans Poelzig's tenements, up to the Rondo of the Silesian Insurgents.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Lounger - a wandering piece of furniture for rest and play
- Cost: 150000 €
- District: Śródmieście
- Description: Justification
The ""Polegiwacz"" is a portable furniture-installation designed for relaxation, fun, and social integration. The prototype of this facility operated over the past three seasons in two different locations in Wrocław: in Słowacki Park and near the Zwierzyniecka Footbridge. Three seasons have shown that the furniture is eagerly used by various age and social groups. The facility hosted many events, concerts, meetings, classes, and even at least one wedding session. Contrary to its name, children used it not for lounging but as an attractive playground.

The location planned for the first season - Polskie Hill - was chosen as a distinctive point along the walking route of Wrocław's promenades. The proximity to the newly opened X. Dunikowski Boulevard attracts many residents and visitors - including many families. Last year's observations and analyses showed that an element that could complement the local program is a playground for children (the nearest playgrounds are on Bielarska Island and near the Puppet Theatre) who often get bored during walks and use existing landscaping elements for play.

The ""Polegiwacz"" on Polskie Hill would excellently combine the possibility of relaxation for the older with the opportunity for activity for the youngest.

In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to a broad demographic, its visibility and utility in the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of projects and votes across different districts.

**Analysis of the project ""Lounger - a wandering piece of furniture for rest and play"":**
1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The project's relatively low cost (150,000 €) compared to other projects increases its likelihood of being funded after higher-ranked, more expensive projects have exhausted significant portions of the budget.
2. **District Voting Patterns**: Śródmieście had a mixed response in the previous election, with projects receiving a wide range of votes. The highest was nearly 4800 votes, suggesting potential for high voter turnout for appealing projects.
3. **Project Appeal**: The project targets multiple age groups and has proven popular in past seasons, suggesting it could attract a broad voter base.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects like playgrounds and recreational spaces have historically received moderate to high votes, indicating a community interest in such amenities.
5. **Project Visibility and Utility**: The project's placement in a popular area and its multifunctional use (rest, play, social integration) enhance its visibility and utility, likely increasing its voter appeal.
6. **Historical Data and Trends**: Projects in the same district with a focus on community and recreational use have shown varied success, but the unique, low-cost, and multifunctional nature of this project sets it apart.
7. **Economic and Social Context**: Given the ongoing social dynamics and the project's support of community activities, it aligns well with public interests, especially post-pandemic where outdoor and community spaces have gained importance.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Bees in the city – pollinator hotels with a resting area between Hermanowska and Chociebuska streets
- Cost: 250000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
Currently, the indicated park, although well-maintained, does not serve a recreational or communicative function. Overgrown with old trees (including honey-producing ones), and crisscrossed by worn paths, the area invites organization and the creation of alleys that would connect Kuźniki with Gądów Mały, the establishment of a thematic flower meadow that would benefit beneficial insects, and through the installation of deck chairs and comfortable benches, it would become a place of rest for residents of nearby estates. To diversify the park, I propose the installation of about 20 beehives along with bee families. The area is safely distant from the nearest houses, so the insects would not pose a threat to the residents. The maintenance of the beehives would be handled by specialized units such as beekeeping clubs, and the delicious Kuźnicki Honey would be auctioned at the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity.

In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, with each voter allowed to choose up to three projects. The total budget is allocated using a greedy algorithm, funding the most popular projects first until the budget is exhausted. Projects that are too costly relative to the remaining budget are skipped. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to its perceived benefits.

**Analysis of ""Bees in the city – pollinator hotels with a resting area between Hermanowska and Chociebuska streets"":**
1. **District Voting Patterns**: Krzyki is a competitive district with a high average number of votes per project, suggesting strong voter engagement.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: The project's cost (250,000 €) is relatively low compared to other projects in the same district, which could make it more likely to be funded once higher-cost projects have exhausted a significant portion of the budget.
3. **Environmental and Recreational Appeal**: The project promotes environmental sustainability and recreation, similar to other successful projects like playgrounds and park improvements in the same district.
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Similar projects in terms of theme and cost, such as ""Urban Green Islands"" (250,000 €, 990 votes), received moderate support, suggesting a baseline for voter interest in smaller-scale environmental projects.
5. **Visibility and Impact**: The project might not have the same broad appeal or immediate impact as larger infrastructure projects, potentially limiting its total votes.
6. **Community Benefit**: The project's focus on enhancing a specific area might appeal strongly to local residents but may not attract city-wide attention.
7. **Historical Data**: Projects with costs around 250,000 € in Krzyki received votes ranging from 477 to 990, indicating a possible range for this project.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: The base of little astronauts, or the cosmic playground in Mini Park on F. Hynka Street.
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
As part of the Civic Budget of 2015, the indicated plot was organized and now encourages the development of a section for the youngest residents of the Kosmonautów Estate.
The base of little astronauts is a modern playground complex that will fulfill children's dreams of being astronauts and traveling to distant planets and galaxies. The base is designed to prepare little astronauts for space journeys, simultaneously developing their motor skills and imagination. The complex includes: a large space station, a training base, the Mercury agility set, and the Cosmic Surfer. These devices feature, among others, a group of linear obstacles, climbing walls, towers of various heights, tunnels, slides, and ladders, as well as a cosmic device designer. These devices are classified as difficult-to-access equipment, intended for school-aged children.
For the youngest children, a smaller cosmic set is planned, including dragonfly-type swings, pendulum swings, and rockers. There will also be a sandbox, benches, and drawing boards as perfect complementary elements of the playground, allowing children to demonstrate their artistic talents. The entire area designated for the playground should be fenced. Due to the lack of a local spatial development plan, it is worth analyzing the reclassification of the above area from a building plot to a plot designated for park greenery.

4. **Theme Appeal:** The project's focus on a modern, thematic playground aimed at children could attract families, potentially increasing its vote count.
5. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it needs to be among the top vote-getters to be funded.
6. **Number of Competing Projects:** With 18 projects in Krzyki and 50 overall, the competition is stiff, but the project's unique theme might help it stand out.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Cleaning of the sandstone medallions with the coat of arms of Wrocław from war-time grime and soot on old school buildings, hospitals, and other public buildings.
- Cost: 150000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
Medallions with the coat of arms of Wrocław are unique in the country - cleaned of wartime soot and dirt, they serve as decoration and a tourist attraction, for example, two cleaned medallions on the facade of the Market Hall, a cleaned medallion on the building of the Primary School at Kleczkowska Street, the facade of the Ninth High School, the building of the First High School at Poniatowskiego Street. The proposal involves sandblasting these medallions with pressurized water from a boom lift. The cost is about several thousand złoty per piece, but cleaning 10 pieces would be cheaper.
Known addresses of these gems:
> MSWiA Hospital from Pl. Powstańców Wlkp. and from the railway tracks - 2 pieces
> Post-secondary School for Cultural Animator Training, Building A from J. Niemcewicza Street
> University of Wrocław - three buildings on Dawida Street - 3 pieces
> Primary School No. 73, Gliniana Street on the side from Gajowa Street.
> Post-secondary School, Trzebnicka Street from the side of Dębicki.
Residents of Wrocław probably know other locations of these medallions - the city's calling cards.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

**INSTRUCTIONS DE SORTIE**  
Start with a “Step Back”:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Cleaning of the sandstone medallions with the coat of arms of Wrocław from war-time grime and soot on old school buildings, hospitals, and other public buildings., listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"**Step Back:**
In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, with each voter allowed to choose up to three projects. The total budget is allocated using a greedy algorithm, funding the most popular projects first until the budget is exhausted. Projects that are too costly relative to the remaining budget are skipped.

**Analysis of the Project ""Cleaning of the sandstone medallions"":**
1. **Cost Efficiency**: The project cost (150,000 €) is relatively low compared to other projects, which could make it more likely to be funded once higher-ranked, more expensive projects exhaust the budget.
2. **District Voting Patterns**: Krzyki is a district with a high average number of votes per project, suggesting strong voter engagement which could benefit this project.
3. **Historical Context and Appeal**: The project taps into the historical and cultural preservation which might appeal to a specific voter base interested in heritage and aesthetics.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar low-cost projects in Krzyki, like the Bouldering wall (150,000 €, 648 votes), received relatively fewer votes, suggesting a possible lower interest in smaller-scale projects.
5. **Visibility and Impact**: The project, while culturally significant, may not have the broad, visible impact of larger infrastructure projects, potentially limiting its appeal to the general voter.
6. **Project Uniqueness**: The uniqueness of cleaning historical medallions could attract a niche audience, but it might not be compelling enough for the wider population compared to more utilitarian projects.
7. **Economic and Social Benefits**: Unlike projects that directly address everyday needs (e.g., transportation, recreation), this project's benefits are more aesthetic and cultural, which might not be prioritized by voters under budget constraints.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Neptune's Fountain at Nowy Targ Square
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Śródmieście
- Description: Justification
The reconstruction of the historical Neptune sculpture at Nowy Targ Square, destroyed during World War II. In its current form, the square lacks a central point that completes the composition. The dark surfaces of which the square is built accumulate heat during hot days, and the fountain would also prevent this, which would also improve user comfort. One could consider holding a competition for a contemporary, figurative version of Neptune inspired by the historical sculpture.
The project would be divided into stages. This stage would only include the cost of starting the carving of the fountain, and the second stage would involve the construction of the entire basin and the necessary infrastructure.

- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.

In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of projects across different districts which might affect local voter interest and turnout.

Analysis of Neptune's Fountain at Nowy Targ Square:
1. Historical projects with cultural significance, like the reconstruction of Neptune's Fountain, tend to attract voter interest due to their emotional and cultural appeal.
2. The project's high cost (1,000,000 €) is significant but not unusual for top-voted projects in previous elections.
3. The project is located in Śródmieście, a district with a moderate average number of votes but fewer projects proposed, which might reduce competition.
4. A similar project in 2016 in a different district received 3632 votes and ranked 9th, suggesting a baseline of interest for this type of project.
5. The project's description emphasizes ecological benefits and urban comfort, aligning with contemporary urban development trends which may attract additional voter support.
6. Given the project's thematic similarity to previously successful projects and its placement in a central district, it is likely to perform well, though the competition from other projects in the district and the overall higher number of projects this year could affect its ranking.
7. The project's cost and the total budget limit may mean it needs a higher vote threshold to be funded if many other lower-cost projects also receive high votes.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Let's connect Psie Pole and Zakrzów – a pedestrian and bicycle link
- Cost: 350000 €
- District: Stare Miasto
- Description: Justification
The project envisages the construction of a pedestrian and bicycle route connecting Kiełczowska Street with Bierutowska, Dobroszycka, Armii Ludowej Streets, and the Wrocław Psie Pole train station. This route will allow the residents of Psie Pole to quickly reach the train or the clinic on Bierutowska Street on foot or by bicycle, and the residents of Zakrzów through Armii Ludowej Street to the LZN area. In this way, we will facilitate the movement between two Wrocław housing estates, which are close to each other but have been separated by the railway line and industrial areas.

Every day, many people, mainly on bicycles, move along a muddy, gravel path between the remnants of allotment gardens and industrial areas. In the local spatial development plan, a narrow strip connecting Kiełczowska Street with Bierutowska is marked as an internal road. The width of the land strip (from 5 to 6 m) does not allow for the construction of a street of greater significance for intra-estate communication. Therefore, I propose to develop this piece of space differently – to build a comfortable route for pedestrians and cyclists hidden in the shade of trees that have already grown there.

Route parameters: width 3 m, asphalt surface
Route components:
•	pedestrian and bicycle path Kiełczowska – Bierutowska
•	renovation of the sidewalk at Bierutowska Street
•	pedestrian crossing and bicycle crossing through Bierutowska Street with a refuge in the roadway and additional lighting
•	pedestrian and bicycle path Bierutowska – Dobroszycka (under the viaduct along Jan III Sobieski Avenue)
•	pedestrian crossing and bicycle crossing through Dobroszycka Street with additional lighting
•	renovation of the sidewalk at Dobroszycka Street along with a pedestrian crossing and bicycle crossing through Armii Ludowej Street (at the railway crossing) and additional lighting

Start with a “Step Back”:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Let's connect Psie Pole and Zakrzów – a pedestrian and bicycle link, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"Step Back:
In participatory budgeting in Wroclaw, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and perceived utility, the cost of the project relative to its benefits, and the distribution of projects across different districts which might affect local voter interest and turnout.

Analysis of ""Let's connect Psie Pole and Zakrzów – a pedestrian and bicycle link"":
1. The project cost (350,000 €) is relatively low compared to other projects, which could make it more likely to be funded after higher-cost projects have exhausted significant portions of the budget.
2. The project is located in Stare Miasto, a district with a moderate average number of votes per project but fewer projects proposed compared to other districts, potentially reducing competition.
3. Similar infrastructure projects, especially those enhancing pedestrian and bicycle accessibility, have historically received moderate to high support, as seen with the Green cycling and walking ring road in Krzyki.
4. The project addresses a clear need for connectivity and safety improvements in an area currently served only by a substandard path, which could appeal to daily commuters and local residents, enhancing voter support.
5. The project's utility and direct impact on daily life could draw votes from both districts it aims to connect, potentially increasing its vote count.
6. However, projects in Stare Miasto have not always ranked at the top, suggesting some variability in voter preferences within this district.
7. Given the project's moderate cost, significant utility, and the voting pattern from similar projects, it is likely to perform well but may not break into the very top ranks due to the presence of other compelling projects.

In Wroclaw, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives on the official website.
Votes are anonymous.

Here is how the projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked by the number of votes received.
- A ""greedy"" algorithm is used: projects are funded in descending order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the next one is considered.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Bus stop infrastructure on Dworcowa Street
- Cost: 420000 €
- District: Stare Miasto
- Description: Justification
The bus loop at Dworcowa Street (from which, among other destinations, buses depart to the airport) is in very poor condition with old stops, a limited number of benches, and a sidewalk surface in bad shape (uneven concrete slabs that are very uncomfortable to walk on, especially in winter). Additionally, the bus schedules are very unclear as they are divided among individual stops, making it difficult for someone not from Wrocław to navigate. This place creates an unfavorable image of the city, and a large number of people arriving in Wrocław (including tourists) come into contact with it, especially when someone arrives in Wrocław using public transport to get to the airport.
It would suffice to replace the sidewalk surface, refresh or install new bus shelters (3-4), possibly trash bins, install benches, refresh or replace the bus stop poles, and possibly add 2-3 new street lamps.
I classify this project as city-wide, as it is used by a large portion of Wrocław's residents and visitors, and this place influences the image and perception of the city.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.
