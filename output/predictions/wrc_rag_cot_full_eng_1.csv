Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Rędziński Park
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The concept of the Park in Maślice was designed based on a survey conducted among its current users. It takes into account two main target groups: families with children and young, active sports enthusiasts. Currently, this area is perceived by residents as a green space—unfortunately, neglected. Given the development of the estate and the need to create new meeting places for residents, as well as Wrocław's efforts to earn the title of European Green Capital, this area should gain a new look.

The park development project includes paths, prepared based on the state of tree cover and potential costs of clearing the trails to a minimum width of 2.5 m—cycling, running, and walking paths—leveled and prepared for stroller access. Additionally, the project includes health trail routes connected by crossings made of wooden bridges, culverts, and balance beams. The paths will be connected to sandy squares where wooden play equipment and willow wigwams will be located. The park's hill will also be utilized—it will be planted with a spiral hedge, and plastic slides will be built into its sides. At the top, there will be a viewing point with a circular gazebo and swing benches.

The park paths will be equipped with a series of educational and sensory boards. Existing blackberry hedges will be densified with raspberry bushes in various varieties and fruiting seasons. The concept also includes the development of two water reservoirs. Two crossings over them in the form of wooden bridges are planned. Near one of the ponds, there will be a spot for exercises with a shock-absorbing surface and a place for outdoor gym equipment. The area will also feature two fire pits, gazebos, benches, and wooden loungers made from tree trunks.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

This suggests a favorable environment for the Rędziński Park project.

2. **Project Cost and Appeal**: The project cost of 1,000,000 € is significant but aligns with other highly supported projects in Krzyki. The comprehensive nature of the project, targeting multiple user groups (families, sports enthusiasts), increases its appeal.

3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects like the Playground for Older Children in Grabiszyński Park and the Green cycling and walking ring road received 6663 and 12348 votes respectively. This indicates a strong voter interest in substantial recreational developments.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: bus stop infrastructure on Dawida Street
- Cost: 250000 €
- District: Śródmieście
- Description: Justification
On Dawida Street (between Dawida Street and Dyrekcyjna Street) there is a bus loop for private carriers, which is heavily used by many residents of Wrocław and people living in the surrounding areas within several dozen kilometers. Unfortunately, Dawida Street lacks decent infrastructure - sidewalks (the existing concrete ones are in poor condition and are uncomfortable to use, especially in winter), bus shelters (even just to protect against rain), benches, street lamps, trash bins, or clear timetables (there are several stops and if someone is not familiar with them, i.e., does not know from which stop a particular carrier departs, it can be a bit confusing). Changes would enable more pleasant and easier use of this bus loop.
I qualify this project as city-wide, as residents from various parts of the city and from nearby towns use this infrastructure.
P.S. I heard that the city plans to change the location of the stops for private carriers - if this is the case, please inform me and possibly then the project will be withdrawn.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.

1. Present your reasoning in 5 to 8 key points, concisely.
2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **Project Cost and Appeal**: The project ""bus stop infrastructure on Dawida Street"" has a relatively low cost (250,000 €) compared to other projects in the district and city-wide. This could make it more appealing to voters as it suggests a high benefit-cost ratio.

2. **District Voting Trends**: In Śródmieście, projects with costs around or below 500,000 € received moderate support, but none were top performers. The most voted project in this district previously was ""Bike-friendly Wrocław 2016"" with a much higher cost and votes.

3. **Similar Projects Analysis**: Similar infrastructure projects across the city, like improvements to streets or public transport facilities, generally received lower votes and rankings. This suggests a trend where infrastructure improvements are not the highest priority for voters.

4. **Project Necessity and Description**: The project addresses a clear need for better infrastructure, which could resonate well with daily commuters and residents using the bus loop, potentially increasing its appeal.

5. **Competition within the District**: With 7 projects proposed in Śródmieście this year, the competition is moderate. The project's success will partly depend on the nature and appeal of the other six projects.

6. **Historical Data and Statistical Estimation**: Based on the average votes for similar projects and considering the specific needs it addresses, the project might attract a moderate number of votes. However, it's unlikely to be among the top voted due to historical trends showing preference for larger or more universal projects.

7. **Budget Allocation Strategy**: Given its lower cost, the project has a higher chance of being funded if it receives a decent number of votes, as the greedy algorithm would favor funding smaller projects once larger projects have exhausted the budget.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: ""Park & ride"" at the Pilczyce/Wrocław Stadium loop
- Cost: 750000 €
- District: Fabryczna
- Description: Justification
""Park & ride"" are parking facilities for those coming to large cities wishing to use public transport. It is an eco-friendly solution used in modern large cities. The project plans to create 80 parking spaces. Due to the proximity of the A8 motorway entrance to the city and the Pilczyce loop (100m), the parking is ideally located for use by people coming from outside Wrocław, who will leave their car in the parking lot and switch to public transport (tram lines: 33, 3, 10, 20; bus line: 128). Additionally, the spaces can be used by people driving to mass events organized at the Municipal Stadium (300m). The implementation of the project will increase the safety of residents and cars parked during events at the stadium. It will also improve the image of the city of Wrocław (especially during stadium events). It will prevent the devastation of green areas. Currently, during mass events at the stadium, due to cars parked on the road, dangerous situations and collisions occur. Due to the lack of space, cars are unable to pass or turn around. Often, they have to back out of the alley up to 200 m. There is devastation of green areas due to the blocked road (passing through lawns and sidewalks) or parking on the lawns.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Operation Square - Street Games ""Taming the Concrete""
- Cost: 150000 €
- District: Śródmieście
- Description: Justification
The project involves placing street games in urban spaces designed for children of various age groups.
The project has two main objectives:
- encourage children to play in urban spaces
- make use of hardened surfaces such as concrete, asphalt, or paving stones.
Street games made of thermoplastic material are a supplement to traditional playgrounds or an idea for utilizing alleys, courtyards, and wastelands, and can serve as a modern educational aid especially for preschool, early school, and physical education teachers, as well as an idea for actively spending free time for entire families.
By transforming gray courtyards and squares into colorful zones for play and learning, we show children
that one can have great fun away from the screen of a monitor and television.
Thermoplastic material is characterized by high resistance to weather conditions, includes anti-slip elements, and the colors do not lose their intensity.
The installation of Smart Plac games involves the thermoplastic material vulcanizing with the hardened surface during heating (with asphalt, paving stones, or concrete), which ensures high durability and longevity of the product.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: I'm sorry, but you didn't provide any text to translate. Please provide the text you would like translated from Polish to English.
- Cost: 50000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The idea behind the ""1997"" project was to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the residents' struggle with the flood, which has been remembered as the Flood of the Millennium.
Twenty locations were selected where a delicate, elongated, copper plaque with the cut-out numbers 1997 will be mounted. The defined places - facades of buildings that had to face the powerful element on July 12-13, 1997, are characteristic points in the city center and housing estates.
The project's aim is to make visitors aware and remind locals of the hardships that the residents of Wrocław had to overcome for life in the city to return to normal. A city-wide nature of the proposal was chosen to illustrate the actual scale of the flood.
The proposal is characterized by modesty; the rectangular plaques are meant to address the flood in a non-didactic way, to intrigue. The proposed size is 40 cm in length and 3 cm in width. The thickness is 1 cm, so as to conceal the mounting. The height of the mounting depends on the water level from July 1997.

- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Safe and friendly roads in Wrocław - speed calming lights instead of speed cameras throughout the city
- Cost: 650000 €
- District: Psie Pole
- Description: Justification
The project proposes changing the operating mode of traffic lights at selected intersections to improve pedestrian comfort and overall safety. The main change will be switching the signals to an ""all-green"" mode for pedestrians – meaning that when there are no cars on the road, the green light will continuously be on at crosswalks, allowing pedestrians to cross freely without having to press buttons and wait. The change occurs only when a column of cars approaches. The second feature would be slowing lights - when a car approaches an intersection or a pedestrian crossing with traffic lights, its speed is monitored by cameras, and if it is driving too fast, the light turns red. The green light comes back on once it reduces speed - if it does not, the camera records the moment of running the red light, and only then is a fine issued. This system is much more driver-friendly than the traditional speed camera - if someone's foot lingers on the gas pedal, they do not immediately receive a fine, but a warning in the form of a red light, and only if they ignore it are they penalized. It is also a more effective solution - it reduces speed in the most dangerous places, namely at intersections and pedestrian crossings. Slowing lights are operational in Wrocław at the intersection of Ślężna and Weigla, so this is not a novelty in our city.
Proposals:
1. Krakowska – pedestrian crossing (signal no. 231)
2. Bardzka – pedestrian crossing (signal no. 243)
3. Popowicka – pedestrian crossing
4. Klecińska – allotment gardens (signal no. 200)

2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **District Voting Patterns**: Psie Pole had an average of 1533.3 votes per project in 2016, which is lower than other districts. This suggests a generally lower voter turnout or interest in projects from this district.

2. **Project Cost and Appeal**: The project cost of 650,000 € is moderate compared to other projects in the district and city. It's less than some of the higher-voted projects in Psie Pole, which could make it more appealing for funding consideration.

3. **Similar Project Performance**: A similar project in the same district (""Safe and friendly roads in Wrocław - speed calming lights instead of speed cameras throughout the city"") received 2070 votes and ranked 18th in 2016. This provides a direct comparison and a baseline for estimating votes.

4. **Theme Relevance and Innovation**: The project focuses on road safety and pedestrian comfort, which is a recurring theme in urban development projects. Its innovative approach (using lights to control speed rather than fines) could attract voter interest due to its practical benefits and novelty.

5. **Comparison with Other Projects**: Projects with similar themes but higher costs had varying success. For instance, ""Bike-friendly Wrocław 2016"" in Śródmieście received 4799 votes and ranked 7th, indicating that transportation and safety projects can perform well if they resonate with voters.

6. **Estimation and Confidence Interval**: Based on the similar project's votes and considering potential increased interest due to the innovative approach, an estimate slightly above the previous votes seems reasonable. A confidence interval is set around this estimate to account for variability in voter interest and turnout.

7. **Ranking and Top Positions**: Given the previous ranking of a similar project and the competitive nature of participatory budgeting, expecting a rank around the middle is realistic. The project's moderate cost and relevance might not be enough to push it into the top 5 or even top 10, especially if there are other compelling projects.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Network of parks in Wrocław – Psie Pole - Zawidawie 2
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Stare Miasto
- Description: Justification
The aim of the project is to create two green areas in the Psie Pole -Zawidawie district - a green square at Psie Pole (behind FAMA) and part of the park at Zakrzów. Connecting areas located on two different sides of Sobieski Avenue aims to activate residents of the entire district around a common project within the framework of WBO 2017. The first part of the project is to be located on plots situated behind the FAMA Library and Cultural Center. The space designated for development is bordered on one side by the access road to the tenements, leading from the parking lot, the parking lot itself (bordering all the mentioned plots), a garbage disposal area, and the FAMA territory (surface laid with granite slabs). The initiative envisages the creation of a green square with a mini playground. In the central location, there would be a colorful Linarium Mount Logan structure in the Triangulum version – 3153303 (or a similar rope structure), placed on a sandy substrate. There would be 4 accesses to the playground – gravel paths (in an X layout) and a path surrounding the square along with benches and garbage bins. The remaining parts would be occupied by flower beds (perennials blooming from spring to autumn) and trees – small-leaved lindens. The second part of the project involves the development of a plot located at Zakrzów, in an area bounded by Kujbyszewska, Królewska, and Zatorska streets. In this space, the plan includes the creation of an irregular gravel path/paths, an integration square for the residents of Os. Sobieski, and a dog run (this is consistent with the concept concerning Unity Park, WBO 2014 project). Additionally, new lawns will be established and trees planted in the designed space. This part of the park will also feature bicycle racks, trash bins, and benches.

}
Before giving your answer, take time to reason thoroughly, but only explain the essential reasoning.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Present your reasoning in 5 to 8 key points, concisely.
2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **Project Theme and Cost**: The proposed project, ""Network of parks in Wrocław – Psie Pole - Zawidawie 2"", is a green initiative with a high cost of 1,000,000 €. Green projects have historically received moderate to high support in Wrocław, but the high cost could be a limiting factor.

2. **District Voting Trends**: The project is located in Stare Miasto, where the average number of votes per project in 2016 was relatively low compared to other districts. The highest voted project in this district received 3632 votes.

3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in terms of theme and cost, such as ""Unity Park – urban recreation"" and ""Dog Field without traffic jams"", received 3026 and 2081 votes respectively. These projects ranked 12th and 17th, indicating a moderate level of support for similar initiatives.

4. **Voter Engagement and Distribution**: With 67103 voters and an average of approximately 2.38 votes per voter, there is a significant pool of votes to be tapped. However, the distribution of votes across 50 projects will dilute the total votes any single project can receive.

5. **Project Appeal and Utility**: The project aims to enhance urban green spaces, which is generally well-received for its community and environmental benefits. However, its appeal might be limited to residents near the project area, potentially reducing its voting base.

6. **Historical Data and Ranking Estimation**: Based on the votes received by similar projects and considering the average voting trends in Stare Miasto, the project is likely to receive a moderate number of votes. It might not be as competitive as the top projects from 2016, which received votes in the range of 6000 to 14000.

7. **Top 5 and Top 10 Potential**: Given the historical data and the nature of the project, it is unlikely to break into the top 5, which typically requires a significantly higher vote count. The top 10 is a possibility but not guaranteed, depending on the competition and voter turnout for this specific election.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Green stops in the city center
- Cost: 320000 €
- District: Fabryczna
- Description: Justification
The project proposes the creation of green stops at selected locations in downtown Wrocław by planting climbing plants on their structures. The vegetation would grow in boxes and would be introduced onto lattices along the sides and back wall of the shelters, without interfering with their structure. Thanks to the planting of climbers, waiting for public transport vehicles will become more pleasant, and the bus shelters will gain a new, more aesthetic form.
The project is part of efforts to earn Wrocław the title of Green Capital of Europe, adds a new aesthetic value to the urban space, and introduces greenery in places that have been devoid of it until now. Similar structures have been successfully functioning for years in many cities including London, Eindhoven, Novi Sad, and this year, Kraków plans to introduce green stops.
Proposed locations for green stops:
- Main Station (3 stops)
- Arkady Capitol (2 stops)
- Bema Square (2 stops)
- Galeria Dominikańska (2 stops)
- Strzegomski Square (Contemporary Museum) (2 stops)

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

Notably, the top-voted project in 2016 was also environmentally themed (""Trees for Wrocław"").

2. **Cost and Voting Impact**: The project cost (320,000 €) is relatively moderate compared to other high-ranking projects from 2016. Lower cost projects can be more appealing as they allow for the possibility of funding multiple projects within the budget constraints.

3. **District Voting Patterns**: Fabryczna has shown strong support for green initiatives, as evidenced by the high votes for similar projects. The average votes for projects in this district were also among the highest in 2016.

5. **Ranking Estimation**: Considering the popularity of green projects in Fabryczna and the moderate cost of the project, it is likely to rank well. However, breaking into the top 5 might be challenging unless it resonates exceptionally well with voters, as top projects typically have very high votes.

6. **Top 10 Potential**: Given the historical data and the nature of the project, it is more likely to secure a spot in the top 10, considering the general appeal of green projects and the project's moderate cost.

7. **Confidence Interval and Estimated Votes**: Based on the voting pattern for similar projects and the overall interest in green initiatives, a reasonable estimate for votes could be around 5000 to 6000.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Reagan Roundabout up to standard! Construction of platforms at Reagan Roundabout.
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Psie Pole
- Description: Justification
Reagan Roundabout is one of the more important transit hubs. Unfortunately, the low edges of the stops make it difficult for the elderly, disabled, or parents with strollers to board. As a result, the boarding and alighting of passengers take longer - we ALL lose out! Enough of the uncomfortable climb into buses or trams!
This is a continuation of the WBO 2016 project no. 82. In the previous edition, project 82 and 686 (convergent) together gathered over 1200 votes, indicating significant interest from residents in the matter of convenient boarding at this important transit point.
The proposed changes include raising the platforms by at least 25 cm on the eastern side (2 platforms from Norwida Street) to minimize the gap during boarding.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Present your reasoning in 5 to 8 key points, concisely.
2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **Historical Voting Data Analysis**: The project ""Raising the platform surfaces at Reagan Roundabout"" in the previous election received 705 votes, ranking 36th. This indicates a moderate level of interest in similar infrastructure improvements at the same location.

2. **District Voting Patterns**: Psie Pole had an average vote count of 1533.3 in 2016, which is lower than some other districts. The highest votes for a project in this district were 3099. This suggests that while the district is active, it does not typically reach the highest voting echelons.

3. **Project Cost and Appeal**: The cost of the project is 1,000,000 €, which is significant and aligns with several other high-cost projects in the district. The project addresses accessibility, which is a critical issue and could draw considerable attention, especially from those directly affected by the issue.

4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in the same district had a varied range of votes, with the most similar previous project garnering 705 votes. However, the continuation aspect of the project might pull in additional votes due to ongoing interest.

5. **Voter Engagement and Project Impact**: The project's focus on improving accessibility at a major transit hub could engage a broader audience, including elderly and disabled residents, potentially increasing its appeal.

6. **Estimation and Confidence Interval**: Based on the previous similar project's performance and considering possible increased interest due to its continuation nature, an estimated vote count could be higher but not among the top. A realistic estimate might be around 1000-1500 votes.

7. **Rank and Top Positions**: Given the historical data and the nature of other projects, it's unlikely that this project will break into the top 5 or even top 10, considering it competes against projects with broader appeal or more significant district-wide impact.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Green Beltway of Wrocław - trees and vines in Wrocław's neighborhoods
- Cost: 100000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The project assumes the planting of trees in all housing estates along the Wrocław Motorway Bypass from Muchobor Wielki through Żerniki, Kuźniki, Pilczyce, Rędzin, Osobowice, Lipa Piotrowska, Widawa, Polanowice, and Pawłowice. The course of the AOW through residential areas and lands that could serve recreational functions (e.g., Pola Osobowickie) results in inconveniences for residents in the form of excessive noise throughout the day, a high amount of air pollution, and moreover, the concrete structure of acoustic screens has questionable aesthetic values. Many sections also lack acoustic insulation. Planting trees would to some extent reduce the unfavorable proximity of the AOW. Concrete acoustic screens could be covered with vines on the outer side.
Along the AOW, there are many places where trees can be planted and existing plantings supplemented (e.g., the area at Sułowska Street: Widawa plot, AR_16, 10/1, where only very small pines grow - adding tall deciduous trees would have a very positive impact on this place), strips along so-called technical roads and others. Near the AOW, there are municipal plots, e.g., in the Osobowice-Rędzin estate, and state-owned property in many places should not be an obstacle.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Present your reasoning in 5 to 8 key points, concisely.
2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **Project Theme and Cost**: The project ""Green Beltway of Wrocław"" focuses on environmental enhancement, similar to other highly supported projects like ""Trees for Wrocław"" and ""Green cycling and walking ring road of Wrocław"". Given its relatively low cost of 100,000 €, it is financially accessible, which could appeal to voters.

2. **District Voting History**: Krzyki, the district for this project, has shown strong support for green and infrastructure projects in the past, with high votes for similar projects. This suggests a favorable voter base for this type of initiative.

3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects with a focus on greenery and environmental improvements have historically received substantial support. For instance, ""Trees for Wrocław"" received the highest votes in 2016, and ""Planting young trees in the area of Wrocław"" also performed well.

4. **Voter Engagement and Project Ranking**: The project's low cost relative to its impact (covering many neighborhoods) could lead to higher voter engagement. Projects under 200,000 € like ""Frisbee Golf"" did not perform as well, but they lacked the broad appeal of environmental improvement.

5. **Statistical Analysis**: Given the average and distribution of votes in Krzyki and similar projects, it's reasonable to estimate a strong voting turnout for this project. Projects in Krzyki like the ""Green cycling and walking ring road of Wrocław"" received over 12,000 votes, indicating a high ceiling for popular projects in this district.

6. **Budget Considerations**: With a total budget of 4,500,000 € and the project's cost being only 100,000 €, it is highly likely to be funded once it crosses a threshold of voter support, making it an attractive choice for strategic voters.

7. **Ranking and Top Positions**: Considering the project's appeal, cost, and the district's voting pattern, it is likely to rank well. However, whether it can enter the top 5 or top 10 will depend heavily on the competition and the nature of other projects proposed this year.

The average votes for Psie Pole projects in 2016 were around 1533.3.

2. **Project Cost and Appeal**: The ""Shelters for free-living cats"" project has a relatively low cost (70,000 €) compared to other projects in the same district. Lower-cost projects might attract more votes due to perceived efficiency and impact per euro spent.

3. **Similar Projects Analysis**: Similar small-scale or animal-related projects in other districts did not receive very high votes, suggesting a niche but not overwhelmingly popular interest. For instance, ""Benches at the Stops"" in Stare Miasto received only 831 votes.

4. **Comparative Analysis within District**: Projects in Psie Pole with costs around 500,000 € to 1,000,000 € received votes in the range of 1912 to 3099. Given the lower cost and possibly narrower appeal of the cat shelter project, it might attract fewer votes than these higher-cost projects.

5. **Voter Engagement and Project Ranking**: Considering the total number of votes and the distribution in the previous election, a project like this might not break into the very top due to its specialized nature but could still perform moderately well due to its low cost and community-focused appeal.

6. **Estimation and Confidence Interval**: Based on the analysis, the estimated votes might be lower than the district average due to the project's niche appeal. A realistic estimate might be around 1000 to 1500 votes, considering the trends and the nature of the project.

7. **Rank and Top Positions**: Given the estimated votes and the typical distribution, the project is unlikely to be in the top 5 or top 10, as these positions are usually occupied by projects with broader appeal or higher visibility.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Sequoia forest, fruit trees and shrubs
- Cost: 150000 €
- District: Stare Miasto
- Description: Justification
1. Few people know that once, powerful and ancient sequoias not only covered the area of the western coast of the USA but were also present throughout Europe. These are some of the oldest trees, as they can live for several thousand years and are certainly the largest of all. Few also know that in Poland, individual specimens grow, as well as in other European countries. The project assumes the initiation of restoring sequoia species in Poland, in Wrocław. The plan is to plant at least 50 of them in Wrocław's parks and forests. For them to function and produce new seedlings, the sequoias should be genetically diverse, originating from different regions/sources. To increase their chances of survival, they should be planted in at least 10 locations, with 5 genetically varied specimens each, along with a possible partial soil exchange for one that has the appropriate pH for them. Consultation with arborists will be useful here.
2. Utilitarian trees on wastelands will be publicly accessible. It takes some time for them to grow and bear fruit, but the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the next best time is now. Volunteers could be involved in the planting action to reduce the cost of this. Therefore, it might be possible to plant more of them eventually. It would be very important to plant a variety of species and seedlings. Plantings on wastelands would not increase the costs of greenery management, as such areas are not cared for as much as parks. Species and varieties should be chosen with special consideration for old Polish valuable and disappearing types, and the choice should be consulted with horticulture specialists.
3. Planting other trees in the city, in residential estates, in the vicinity of streets, squares, and plazas.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.

Its cost (150,000 €) is relatively low compared to other projects, making it financially accessible and potentially more appealing to voters.

2. **District Voting History**: The district of Stare Miasto has shown support for a variety of projects, but the most voted project in 2016 was ""Neptune's Fountain at Nowy Targ Square"" with 3632 votes. The average votes for projects in this district were lower compared to districts like Krzyki.

3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar environmental projects in other districts received substantial votes, suggesting a general voter interest in green initiatives. However, the specific interest in Stare Miasto for such projects needs to be cautiously estimated given the mixed nature of previously popular projects.

4. **Voter Engagement and Trends**: The project's theme of planting sequoias and enhancing green spaces could resonate well given global trends towards environmental sustainability. This might attract a significant number of votes, especially from environmentally conscious voters.

5. **Budget Allocation and Project Cost**: Given its lower cost, the project has a higher chance of being funded after higher-cost projects are considered, assuming it garners enough votes. This strategic cost advantage could place it favorably in the funding list.

6. **Estimation of Votes and Ranking**: Based on the analysis of similar projects and considering the average voting patterns in Stare Miasto, the project might attract a moderate number of votes. It is unlikely to surpass the highest voted projects but could perform reasonably well.

7. **Top 5 and Top 10 Potential**: Given the project's moderate appeal and strategic cost, it might not reach the top 5 but has a potential to be in the top 10, especially if voter turnout and interest in green projects increase.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: City toilets in parks befitting Wrocław.
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Śródmieście
- Description: Justification
The initiative is a response to the problem of a lack of public toilets in the recreational spaces of the city. It involves the construction of 3 facilities in Wrocław parks, which are still not equipped with such amenities (Western Park, Grabiszyński Park, and Eastern Park). The toilet project was honored with the Grand Prix award at the KOŁO Bathroom 2015 competition.

The comprehensive program of the facility includes:
toilets: male, female, and for disabled persons
a room for mothers with children
a covered resting place (bench)
a drinking fountain and a place for animals to drink water
bicycle racks
a technical room
The cost of implementing one facility is about 330,000 PLN - an amount of 1 million PLN would allow for the construction of 3 such toilets.

The project will enrich the parks with a hygienic and functional space, giving park users greater freedom. The concept is universal and flexible, and its scope can be expanded to include additional parks.

Post-competition reviews:
“The winning project is a multifunctional concept, naturally integrated into the park space. The center of the composition is a tree that serves as a spatial and symbolic reference point for the project.”
“The principle adopted for the toilet complex is simple and modest, adapted to the necessary intimacy of using the space while ensuring the assigned cultural function and an impressive and elegant setting. Inexpensive and easy-to-maintain finishing materials will provide a good backdrop for the effectively proposed lighting, which will enrich the garden space in the evening and at night,” explains the jury's choice.

2. **Historical Voting Patterns**: Projects in Śródmieście have varied widely in their vote counts, but the most successful ones (like ""Bike-friendly Wrocław 2016"") have garnered close to 5000 votes. Given the utility and broad appeal of the proposed project, it could attract a similar level of interest.

3. **Utility and Appeal**: The project addresses a clear need for public amenities in parks, which is a universal concern likely to attract votes from a wide demographic, similar to other successful projects like playgrounds and park enhancements.

4. **Award and Recognition**: The project has received an award, which might enhance its visibility and perceived value among voters, potentially increasing its appeal.

5. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar utility-focused projects in other districts have received moderate to high votes, suggesting a good baseline interest in practical improvements within community spaces.

6. **Vote Estimation and Confidence Interval**: Considering the project's appeal, district voting history, and comparison with similar projects, an estimated vote count of around 4000 seems reasonable. Given uncertainties in voter turnout and competition, a confidence interval from 3000 to 5000 votes is proposed.

7. **Ranking and Top Positions**: With an estimated vote count of around 4000, the project could realistically aim for a top 10 finish, similar to other high-cost, high-utility projects. However, breaking into the top 5 might be more challenging unless it significantly outperforms expectations.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Greenery for Wrocław – pocket parks, plantings, green enclaves throughout the city!
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Psie Pole
- Description: Justification
In Wrocław, there has been a declarative change regarding greenery and environmental care in general. Unfortunately, changes do not occur too quickly on a daily basis. The city still lacks trees in many places, even though the existing underground networks do not interfere with plantings. During the construction of new buildings, there is no consideration for landscaping with anything other than low vegetation (shrubs or grasses), which results in empty spaces around them that heat up quickly, which is particularly troublesome in the summer.

Another problem is the neglected green spaces, and often those devoid of greenery. They could serve as meeting places for residents, make waiting for the tram more pleasant, or simply provide an opportunity to rest among vegetation. Unfortunately, worn-out lawns, lack of benches, or shade do not encourage such activities.

Another issue is the valuable green enclaves from a biodiversity perspective, which can be found especially in peripheral estates. It is worth preserving them, cleaning them up, and equipping them with infrastructure for animals, such as birdhouses or hedgehog houses.

Therefore, as part of the Greenery for Wrocław project, I propose creating pocket parks in various places around the city, additional tree plantings, and the protection of natural green enclaves.

The beneficiaries of the project will be all city residents living or working/studying near the selected locations. The implementation of the project will also positively affect the local climate and improve the aesthetics of public spaces.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

Before giving your answer, take time to reason thoroughly, but only explain the essential reasoning.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Present your reasoning in 5 to 8 key points, concisely.
2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **Project Theme and Popularity**: The project ""Greenery for Wrocław – pocket parks, plantings, green enclaves throughout the city!"" is similar in theme to the highly popular ""Trees for Wrocław"" from 2016, which received the most votes. This suggests a strong interest in greenery and environmental projects among the voters.

2. **District Voting History**: Projects in the Psie Pole district have historically received fewer votes compared to other districts like Krzyki and Fabryczna. The highest votes for a project in Psie Pole were around 3000 votes, which is significantly lower than the top projects city-wide.

3. **Cost and Budget Impact**: The project cost is 1,000,000 €, which is a substantial amount. High-cost projects need to garner significant voter support to justify their budget allocation, especially under the greedy algorithm used for funding.

4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in terms of theme and district have shown varied success. The ""Expansion of the sports base in Wrocław's Osobowice"" in Psie Pole received 3008 votes. This project, while not directly comparable, indicates potential voter support levels for substantial community projects in the district.

5. **Voter Engagement and Trends**: Assuming similar voter engagement as in 2016, with a focus on green projects due to increasing environmental awareness, this project could attract attention. However, it might not reach the very top due to its district's historically lower voting turnout and the high competition from other districts.

6. **Estimation and Ranking**: Based on the analysis, the project is likely to perform well but may not break into the top ranks city-wide. It is expected to gather votes comparable to or slightly higher than the top projects from Psie Pole in 2016 due to its relevance and the current environmental context.

7. **Top 5 and Top 10 Potential**: Given the historical data and the nature of the project, it is less likely to be in the top 5 but has a reasonable chance to be in the top 10, considering it might resonate well with the current voter base's preferences.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Physicists' Boulevard - a scientific playground in the urban space (city-wide)
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Psie Pole
- Description: Justification
We propose the creation of an installation initially comprising several educational devices for children, youth, and adults related to physics on the J. Zwierzycki Boulevard adjacent to the building of the Faculty of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Wrocław. The devices are intended to be unique, hence they will not be numerous and will be custom-made or ordered from specialized companies. The project is designed to initiate a larger whole, which we aim to implement in the future (a science park).

In Wrocław, there is a lack of recreational areas with an educational function. Warsaw has its Copernicus Center, Wrocław has the Humanitarium - small and very distant from the center, only with a temporary exhibition installation in the building. In this context, our project will be unique in Wrocław and the surrounding area.

Additionally, the project assumes the creation of both the entire concept and the landscaping, which will allow for the installation of these devices on the (beautiful) boulevard in an aesthetic and coherent manner with the surroundings.

The details of the devices, their form, and physical content will be determined with the project leader in collaboration with the scientific staff of the Faculty of Physics and Astronomy during the project implementation stage.

- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Wrocław parks available to everyone.
- Cost: 200000 €
- District: Fabryczna
- Description: Justification
Parks are an integral part of the urban fabric. They enable pleasant and quick contact with nature. Due to their location and the infrastructure on their premises, many of them are also tourist attractions. To increase the accessibility of Wrocław's parks, the project proposes placing tactile maps at the entrances to selected parks. These plans will allow blind and visually impaired individuals to familiarize themselves with the topography of the areas depicted. They will learn the layout of paths and the location of interesting objects. Descriptions in black print will make the maps accessible to all visitors to Wrocław's parks and help them reach interesting places.
The tactile plans made of stainless steel with engraving will be resistant to weather conditions and potential vandalism attacks. Proposed locations:
1. Szczytnicki Park (entrance near Hala Stulecia tram stop), 2. Szczytnicki Park (entrance near Kochanowskiego tram stop), 3. Grabiszyński Park (entrance near Oporów tram stop), 4. Grabiszyński Park (entrance near Grabiszyńska Cmentarz II tram stop), 5. Western Park (entrance near DH Astra tram stop), 6. Western Park (entrance near Kolista tram stop), 7. Southern Park (near Orla tram stop), 8. Southern Park (entrance near Krzyki tram stop), 9. J. Słowacki Park (intersection of Słowackiego Avenue with Staromiejska Promenade), 10. Leśnicki Park (entrance near Świętojański Square).
Additionally, the project includes the creation of an educational trail in Szczytnicki Park, which will consist of 20 hardened thermoforms of leaves from trees most commonly found in Poland. Additionally, the embossed graphics will be supplemented with black print and Braille descriptions of each species.
The cost of purchasing one plan is approximately 13,000 PLN, and the cost of purchasing one thermoform is approximately 3,300 PLN.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Construction of the Wrocław handbike type integrative bicycle rental facility along with appropriate social and sanitary facilities.
- Cost: 600000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The project is designed for both disabled and able-bodied residents of Wrocław, as well as for guests and tourists.
Handbike bicycles allow for free and independent movement around the city despite any physical limitations. Thanks to the rental service, disabled individuals will be able to more fully enjoy the benefits of urban life, regardless of communication barriers. Creating such a place will allow for the integration of able-bodied and disabled people.
The project consists of two elements: the first is a bicycle shelter with handbike bicycles housed within; the second element is a social-sanitary building in a container (single-story) construction with an area of about 50 sqm. The building, intended for office or exhibition use and accessible throughout the year, will provide a space where cyclists can rest, share experiences, use a restroom adapted for the disabled, eat a meal, repair or adjust their bicycles. The building will be fully architecturally adapted to the needs of disabled persons.
The building, serving among other things as a community center, club, or simply a meeting place, will be equipped with the aforementioned toilet module, a kitchen sink with cabinetry, appliances such as a kettle, toaster, sandwich maker, microwave oven, tables, chairs, cabinets, bicycle tools, a lift, and a heating-cooling system.
We have several years of experience in operating and developing the Integrated Bicycle Rental www.roweryintegracyjne.pl.
The organization of activities undertaken as a result of the project will be handled by employees and volunteers of the DOBRY CEL foundation, which has supported socially excluded individuals since its inception.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Wrocław at your fingertips – tactile maps of selected areas of Wrocław.
- Cost: 130000 €
- District: Stare Miasto
- Description: Justification
The market and all places such as Ostrów Tumski, Centennial Hall with the Pergola are an undisputed tourist attraction of the city. But does everyone have equal access to them? Blind and visually impaired people have difficulty moving independently in unfamiliar terrain. Also, a person with a mobility disability should have the opportunity to enjoy the attractions offered by the city.

An ideal solution are tactile maps located in several important places, such as Ostrów Tumski, Centennial Hall with the Pergola, Słodowa Island, Piasek Island, the Market Square, National Forum of Music with Podwale, the Palace in Leśnica, the Old Town Park with the Puppet Theater, and Dunikowski Boulevard. These are tactile maps with a simplified representation of space and marking of the most important zones and points. They contain descriptions in Braille and help in optimally designing a route.

The maps allow for spatial orientation of blind and visually impaired people, as well as sighted individuals. They are made of durable material. The maps clearly represent the topography of the terrain for people with visual impairments, while allowing for independent movement around the city. Able-bodied people can use them like traditional maps. Thus, the maps will be attractive to tourists and residents.

We all want to explore and experience new places and attractions. We also have an internal need for social responsibility for those less fortunate. Let's do something together by combining all these needs and allow others to touch Wrocław. Let our city be adapted for the disabled. Let's show how it's done!

The cost of purchasing one plan is about 13,000 PLN.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Present your reasoning in 5 to 8 key points, concisely.
2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **Project Cost and Appeal**: The project ""Wrocław at your fingertips – tactile maps of selected areas of Wrocław"" has a relatively low cost (130,000 €) compared to other projects, which could make it more appealing to voters who prefer cost-effective initiatives. Its focus on accessibility for the disabled also taps into social responsibility, potentially increasing its appeal.

2. **District Voting History**: In the Stare Miasto district, projects have received a wide range of votes, with the highest being 3632 votes for the Neptune's Fountain project. The average vote count for projects in this district is lower compared to other districts like Krzyki.

3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects that focus on inclusivity or public utility (like the handbike rental facility and public toilets) have received moderate to low support, suggesting that while there is interest in such projects, they do not typically receive the highest votes.

4. **Voter Engagement and Project Ranking**: Given the total number of votes and the number of projects, a project needs a significant number of votes to be in the top rankings. Projects in the top 10 in 2016 received votes ranging from 2260 to 13938.

5. **Project's Unique Appeal**: The tactile maps project is unique in its focus on both disability access and tourist utility, which might not only appeal to a niche group but also to general voters who see the value in enhancing city accessibility for all.

6. **Estimated Votes and Ranking**: Based on the analysis of similar projects and the average voting pattern in Stare Miasto, it is estimated that the project might attract a moderate number of votes. Considering its unique appeal but also the moderate enthusiasm for similar projects, it might not reach the very top but could perform decently.

7. **Top 5 and Top 10 Potential**: Given the historical data and the nature of the project, it is less likely to be in the top 5 but has a potential to be in the top 10, especially due to its lower cost and social appeal.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Renovation of the Historic Fredruś Bus
- Cost: 430000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The Jelcz MEX convertible bus - Fredruś is listed in the register of monuments of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship. It was donated to the city in 1974 during the Wrocław Days. Since then, it has become a symbol of the city, transporting tourists and residents.
The name ""Fredruś"" was given in honor of Aleksander Fredro. However, since 2009 the bus has been immobilized and its prolonged exposure to the open air has severely deteriorated its technical condition, and now substantial financial resources are necessary to restore it to operation. This includes a complete reconstruction of the body, regeneration of details, and the vehicle's driving system, including the engine.
The project's goal is to enable residents, tourists, and guests to explore our city in an interesting way, and it should be noted that this bus has graced all parades and festivals of Wrocław. Let's renovate Fredruś and return it to the residents.

2. **District Voting Patterns**: Krzyki district projects generally receive higher votes, with an average of 3055.82 votes per project in 2016. This district's projects also tend to rank well, indicating strong voter engagement.

3. **Project Cost and Appeal**: The cost of the new project (430,000 €) is moderate compared to other projects in Krzyki and less than the average cost of top-ranked projects from 2016. This could make it more likely to be funded within the budget constraints.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: ""Konikowo"" - Construction of an original playground at the Wrocław Racecourse - Partynice
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Stare Miasto
- Description: Justification
Dear Residents of Wrocław, Dear Neighbors,
I represent the informal group ""I am from Ołtaszyn and the surrounding area – TOGETHER MORE VIBRANTLY"" (over 2200 members), who act together, help each other, and recommend family-friendly places. Very important spots on the map of Wrocław are playgrounds, and as we notice, there are still far too few of them.
Therefore, I am asking for support for our playground project on the premises of the Wrocław Racecourse – Partynice.
Why at Partynice?
- It is a public space (green, quiet, and safe area).
- It is easily accessible by public transport or car.
- There are horses here, loved by children.
- There is suitable infrastructure, toilets, a bar with great homemade food.
- The outdoor events organized here attract thousands of residents of Wrocław. As the Racecourse Management announces, during horse races, children will be taken care of by professional animators who will ensure fun and supervision.
- The surrounding playgrounds are mostly located in closed, constantly developing estates or are unfriendly (polluted, difficult to access, without shade, in a noisy place, by the street, etc.).
The proposed project will ensure safety and psychomotor development of children thanks to original and authorial equipment related to horses and equestrianism.
The Krzyki-Partynice neighborhood council has embraced our idea with enthusiasm.
Both the Racecourse Management and the residents care about making our area open to families and enabling spending time outdoors in a friendly environment.
We invite you to vote!!!
Come to Partynice!!

2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **Project Theme and Appeal**: The proposed project ""Konikowo"" focuses on creating a playground, which is a popular theme based on past participatory budgeting results. Projects aimed at children and families tend to gather significant community support.

2. **District Voting History**: Stare Miasto has shown varied support for projects, with the highest votes in 2016 being 3632 for Neptune's Fountain. However, the average votes for projects in this district are lower compared to others like Krzyki.

3. **Cost and Competition**: The project cost is 1,000,000 €, which is a significant amount. This high cost might limit its feasibility under the budget constraints unless it garners substantial voter support. Additionally, there are 11 projects competing in the same district this year, which could dilute the votes.

4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in terms of theme (playgrounds and recreational spaces) have received a decent number of votes, such as the Playground for Older Children in Grabiszyński Park with 6663 votes. This suggests a potentially strong voter base for the ""Konikowo"" project.

5. **Social and Community Engagement**: The project description highlights strong community involvement and support, which can be crucial in driving voter turnout and support.

6. **Estimated Votes and Ranking**: Based on the analysis of similar projects and district voting trends, it's estimated that ""Konikowo"" could attract a significant number of votes, potentially aligning with higher voted projects in similar themes but likely less than the top projects in more popular districts.

7. **Top 5 and Top 10 Potential**: Given the high competition and the historical voting patterns in Stare Miasto, it might be challenging for ""Konikowo"" to break into the top 5, especially considering projects in other districts with historically higher votes. Top 10 is a possibility but not guaranteed.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Present your reasoning in 5 to 8 key points, concisely.
2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **Project Theme and District Analysis**: The project ""Grabiszyński Park - safe access!"" focuses on infrastructure improvement, specifically sidewalk renovation, which is a practical and often popular choice among voters. It is located in the Stare Miasto district, which historically has had a lower average vote count per project compared to other districts like Krzyki and Fabryczna.

2. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in the same district, such as ""Neptune's Fountain at Nowy Targ Square"" and ""Dog Field without traffic jams,"" received 3632 and 2081 votes respectively. These projects, although different in nature, indicate a potential for high voter interest in substantial infrastructural improvements within Stare Miasto.

3. **Cost and Voting Impact**: The project cost is 1,000,000 €, which is significant and aligns with other high-cost projects that have historically received a substantial number of votes. High-cost projects tend to be ambitious and can attract more voter attention if the perceived benefits are widespread.

4. **Historical Data and Vote Estimation**: Based on the average votes in Stare Miasto and the nature of similar projects, it's reasonable to estimate that this project could attract a similar level of interest as ""Neptune's Fountain at Nowy Targ Square,"" which was the highest voted project in Stare Miasto in the previous election.

5. **Ranking and Budget Considerations**: Given the total budget and the cost of the project, along with its potential popularity, it is likely to be ranked within the top 10 if it performs similarly to the ""Neptune's Fountain"" project. However, breaking into the top 5 would require surpassing more universally appealing projects from districts with historically higher voting averages.

6. **Confidence Interval Calculation**: Considering the variability in voter turnout and interests, a confidence interval is estimated around the projected vote count, taking into account the standard deviation observed in the previous election and adjusting for the specific district and project nature.

7. **Final JSON Output**: The estimated votes, confidence interval, expected rank, and likelihood of being in the top 5 or 10 are calculated based on the above analysis and historical data.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Revitalization of Ruska Street
- Cost: 750000 €
- District: Psie Pole
- Description: Justification
The aim of the project is the renovation of Ruska Street (section from Kazimierza Wielkiego to Solny Square), taking into account the high pedestrian traffic in this area - transforming it into a pedestrian route, accessible to bicycles. The transformation seen on Kuźnicza and Oławska Streets could be replicated here, with even greater success anticipated.

Ruska Street needs renovation. It is a route with great potential - it connects a transit hub with the Market Square, and there is room for more attractive services on the ground floors of buildings. Moreover, several underground car parks have been established in the area (Times office building, NFM). Ruska should feature trees and benches, and a suggested bicycle lane could be marked (e.g., with a different shade of pavement).

During the renovation, only pedestrian-friendly surfaces should be used (as seen on Kuźnicza Street, the residents of Wrocław do not accept cobblestones).
*In case the renovation turns out to cost more than 1 million PLN, the first phase should be carried out, e.g., revitalization of part of the indicated street section.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

The average votes for Psie Pole projects in 2016 were 1533.3, which is lower than the city-wide average.

2. **Project Cost and Appeal**: The cost of the ""Revitalization of Ruska Street"" project is 750,000 €, which is a moderate amount compared to other projects in the same district. Projects with similar costs in Psie Pole have received votes ranging from 531 to 2070.

3. **Project Comparison**: Similar projects in terms of renovation and cost in Psie Pole have not ranked very high or received a large number of votes. For instance, ""Street Stawowa Renovation"" (700,000 €) received only 531 votes.

4. **Project Theme and Utility**: The project aims to enhance pedestrian and bicycle access, which aligns with broader urban trends favoring sustainable and accessible city environments. This could appeal to a wider audience, potentially increasing its vote count.

5. **Historical Top Project Votes**: The top projects in Psie Pole in 2016 received between 1912 and 3099 votes. Given the appeal of the ""Revitalization of Ruska Street"" project, it might perform better than the lower-ranked projects but may not surpass the highest-ranked ones.

6. **Estimation and Ranking**: Based on the analysis, the project is likely to receive a moderate number of votes, estimated around the lower end of the top projects from 2016 in Psie Pole. It is unlikely to be in the top 5 city-wide due to the district's lower voting averages but could be close to the top 10 within the district.

7. **Confidence Interval Calculation**: Given the variability and the nature of new projects, a confidence interval is estimated to account for potential higher appeal due to its sustainable focus or lower due to competition with other appealing projects.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Present your reasoning in 5 to 8 key points, concisely.
2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **District Voting Trends**: Projects in Psie Pole have historically received fewer votes compared to other districts like Krzyki and Fabryczna. The average votes for Psie Pole projects in 2016 were 1533.3, which is lower than the city-wide average.

2. **Project Cost and Appeal**: The proposed project's cost (750,000 €) is moderate and aligns with other similarly priced projects in the district that have received a decent number of votes. The project's multifunctional nature (recreation, sports, and community facilities) should appeal broadly to the district's residents.

3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in terms of functionality and district location, like the expansion of the sports base and the construction of the inclusive bike rental facility, received between 1912 and 3008 votes. This suggests a potential voting range for the new project.

4. **Project Uniqueness and Need**: The project's focus on developing a previously underutilized area and adding diverse facilities could address unmet needs in the community, potentially increasing its attractiveness.

5. **Historical Data and Ranking**: Analyzing the votes of similar projects and their costs, projects around the 750,000 € mark in Psie Pole have not typically broken into the top 10. The highest was around rank 20.

6. **Estimation and Confidence Interval**: Based on the analysis and comparison with similar projects, an estimated vote count can be cautiously optimistic but should consider the lower average turnout for the district. A confidence interval can be established around this estimate to account for variability in voter interest and turnout.

7. **Top 5 and Top 10 Potential**: Given the historical data and the competitive nature of projects with higher budgets and broader appeal in more populous districts, it is unlikely that this project would make it into the top 5. The top 10 is also challenging but slightly more plausible if the project resonates well with the voters.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Urban Green Islands
- Cost: 250000 €
- District: Stare Miasto
- Description: Justification
This year, smog has made its presence felt by all residents of Wrocław. Studies have shown that we could breathe clean air for only a few days! The data is alarming. Meanwhile, during the summer, so-called urban heat islands form in our area, causing an artificial increase in temperature compared to the surrounding areas. How can we deal with the negative effects of urbanization? What can be done to make life easier for us, the residents of Wrocław? How can we reduce these negative effects that impact our health? We propose a globally tested system for reducing the negative effects of smog and urban heat islands, which involves installing specialized panels planted with moss and capable of supporting other plants. This project fits perfectly into the concept of Green Wrocław. It is also an excellent idea for originally enhancing urban space. The main function of the panels will be the reduction of air pollution – plants, especially mosses, have the ability to simultaneously absorb many different pollutants from the air, including polluting gases (NOX, CO2, CO, and O3) and suspended particulates. Moss provides an excellent substrate and is resistant to low temperatures. On hot days, the panels lower the temperature through water evaporation. The panels also contribute to noise reduction. The panels have a proper irrigation system that keeps the plants alive, moisturizes the air around the installation, and reduces air dustiness. Mosses are excellent reservoirs of rainwater, thus they are helpful during heavy downpours. The panels have other advantages too - greenery improves mood and reduces stress. Wrocław would be the first city in Poland to boast such a modern and eco-friendly solution.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.

2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **Project Theme and Relevance**: The ""Urban Green Islands"" project addresses critical environmental issues like smog and urban heat islands, which are increasingly relevant to urban populations. Projects with environmental and health benefits have historically resonated well with voters, as seen with the top-ranked ""Trees for Wrocław"" in 2016.

2. **Cost and Budget Considerations**: At 250,000 €, the project is relatively affordable compared to other high-ranking projects from 2016. This lower cost could allow it to be easily funded within the available budget, making it an attractive option for voters who want to see more projects implemented.

3. **District Voting Patterns**: Stare Miasto had projects with a wide range of votes in 2016, but none reached the very high numbers seen in some other districts. The average votes for projects in this district were lower than in districts like Krzyki and Fabryczna.

4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar environmental projects like ""Trees for Wrocław"" received a high number of votes. Although ""Urban Green Islands"" is in a different district, the thematic similarity suggests a potential for high voter interest.

5. **Voter Engagement and Trends**: Assuming similar voter turnout and behavior as in 2016, and considering the increasing awareness and concern about environmental issues, it is reasonable to expect a good response to this project.

6. **Estimation and Ranking**: Based on the analysis, the project could attract a significant number of votes, potentially placing it well within the top 15. However, breaking into the top 5 might be challenging given the competition from projects in districts with historically higher voting averages.

7. **Confidence Interval Consideration**: Given the variability in voting, a confidence interval is estimated to account for different potential voter turnouts and interests.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Toilets in Wrocław parks and recreational areas.
- Cost: 900000 €
- District: Śródmieście
- Description: Justification
In parks and green areas in Wrocław, there is a lack of toilets, which makes it difficult to use them for recreational purposes for an extended period.
We propose the installation of toilets (technology optional, probably the best would be self-cleaning and/or vandalism-resistant).
We propose the following locations:
1) Szczytnicki Park
2) Eastern Park
3) Southern Park
4) Millennium Park
5) Western Park
6) Karłowice (Kasprowicz Park or Karłowicka Glade or Brodzik)
The details of the placement will be determined with the project leader. In case any of the aforementioned parks already has a toilet at the time of the project's win, together with UMW, we will choose another location.

- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Present your reasoning in 5 to 8 key points, concisely.
2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **Project Theme and Demand**: The project ""Toilets in Wrocław parks and recreational areas"" addresses a basic need in public spaces, which is likely to have broad appeal among voters who use these parks and face inconvenience due to the lack of facilities.

2. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar utility projects like ""Public toilet in Eastern Park"" received 1441 votes. Although this project had a much lower cost, it suggests a moderate interest in such amenities.

3. **District Voting Patterns**: In Śródmieście, the highest voted project in 2016 was ""Bike-friendly Wrocław 2016"" with 4799 votes. Projects in this district did not generally receive extremely high votes compared to other districts like Krzyki.

4. **Cost Consideration**: At 900,000 €, the project is expensive but not the most expensive. This cost is significant but might not deter voters if they feel the utility of the project justifies the expense.

5. **Project Visibility and Impact**: The project covers multiple popular parks, which increases its visibility and potential impact on a larger number of residents, possibly enhancing its appeal.

6. **Historical Data and Statistical Analysis**: Based on the average and distribution of votes in Śródmieście and similar projects, it's reasonable to estimate a moderate to high interest, but not the highest due to the district's voting trends.

7. **Ranking and Budget Allocation**: Given the cost and potential vote estimate, the project might struggle to be in the top 5 due to budget constraints and competition from other high-impact or lower-cost projects. However, it has a reasonable chance to be in the top 10.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Present your reasoning in 5 to 8 key points, concisely.
2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **Project Cost and Appeal**: The project ""Large outdoor chess in the center of Wrocław"" has a relatively low cost (250,000 €) compared to many other projects. Lower-cost projects can be more appealing as they are perceived as low-risk and high-benefit.

2. **District Voting Patterns**: Stare Miasto had an average vote count of 1485.29 in 2016, which is on the lower side compared to other districts. However, projects like ""Neptune's Fountain at Nowy Targ Square"" in the same district received significantly higher votes (3632), indicating potential for high voter turnout for appealing projects.

3. **Similar Project Analysis**: A similar project, ""Outdoor chess with large-scale pieces in the city center"" in Fabryczna, received only 619 votes and ranked 39th. This suggests that the concept might not be extremely popular, although district differences could impact this.

4. **Comparative Cost and Theme**: The cost of the chess project is similar to ""Nextbike city bike stations"" which received 1506 votes. Given the unique appeal of a large outdoor chess set, it might attract comparable or slightly higher interest.

5. **Voter Engagement and Project Theme**: The theme of the project (outdoor chess) is unique and could attract specific community groups interested in chess and outdoor activities, potentially increasing its vote count.

6. **Total Number of Projects and Competition**: With 50 projects in the upcoming election and 11 in Stare Miasto, the competition is stiff. The project needs to stand out significantly in its appeal to climb the ranks.

7. **Estimation and Ranking**: Based on similar projects and district averages, the chess project might receive votes around the lower middle range of previous similar projects. It's unlikely to be in the top 5 due to its niche appeal but could aim for a mid-tier ranking.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Pedestrian and bicycle paths along Opatowicka Street.
- Cost: 500000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
Along Opatowicka Street, there are several sections of flood embankments, on top of which are hardened paths. They are perfect for walks, bike rides, and running. Between the ""embanked"" sections, there are no paths separated from the road, allowing for the safe movement of pedestrians, runners, and cyclists. This has been particularly noticeable since the road section between the eastern bypass of Wrocław and Trestno was renovated, which has led to a significant increase in the volume of cars driving on Opatowicka Street. The completed paths would connect the entire loop: the footbridge near the zoo (from the Oder side), embankments along Sępolno, Biskupin, Bartoszewicz, Opatowicka weir, Opatowicka Island, Opatowicka lock, Opatowicka Street, Międzyrzecka Street.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Safer at the intersection of Sobieski Avenue and Wilanowska Street
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The project aims to improve safety at the exit from al. Sobieskiego onto Zakrzów. This location witnesses numerous accidents (including fatal ones), primarily caused by vehicles from Mirków rear-ending vehicles turning left into ul. Wilanowska. The occurrence of dangerous situations is contributed to by excessive vehicle speeds and long waiting times for turning towards Zakrzów during afternoon hours.

Additionally, there is frequent violation of the no-left-turn rule from ul. Wilanowska towards the city boundary. Often, this maneuver is performed by trucks, resulting in the trailer blocking the road towards the city center.

The forced right of way by vehicles exiting the parking lots on ul. Wilanowska also plays a significant role. This is due to the unintuitive signage and unclear geometry of this part of the intersection.

Since this is the most frequented entrance to our estate and is traversed by bus line 150, the current state of safety at this location is unacceptable to the residents of Zakrzów.

The project scope includes:
- drafting a traffic organization plan that will facilitate the left turn from al. Sobieskiego into ul. Wilanowska, increase the throughput of the left turn, reduce the speed of vehicles heading towards the city center, and prevent exits from ul. Wilanowska towards Mirków
- construction works (introduction of new traffic organization elements and road safety devices, and possible adjustment of the intersection geometry)
- potential installation of speed control devices

We do not provide specific solutions (construction of traffic lights, installation of vibratory lines on the road, installation of speed cameras, etc.), as we believe that the effectiveness of the measures applied is guaranteed only by an analysis of the problem conducted during the project drafting stage.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: On foot from Brochów - completion of the missing sidewalk on I. Mościckiego, Gazowa, and Karwińska Streets (mainly concerns the viaduct over the tracks connecting these three streets)
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
From Brochów, it is impossible to leave on foot without walking the streets - there are no sidewalks. Indeed, some time ago, I. Mościckiego Street was widened with a gravel strip, which was probably meant to substitute for a sidewalk but only up to the railway viaduct on Wiaduktowa Street. The aim of the project is to construct safe sidewalks, enabling the residents of Brochów to leave the estate without having to use public transport or cars. Very often, children returning from school use the viaduct connecting I. Mościckiego Street with Gazowa and Karwińska Streets, which is very dangerous because the traffic there is really heavy, and there is virtually no shoulder, while crossing with a child in a stroller is impossible. The project will also include additional lighting over these streets, especially over the pedestrian crossing on I. Mościckiego Street near the bus stops, before the railway viaduct (from the city center side). When driving there at night, it is very difficult to see anyone on these strips because just before them is the last street lamp, and before the driver's eyes adjust to the darkness, they are already past the pedestrian crossings. An accident in this place is easily conceivable.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Honey Meadows in Wrocław
- Cost: 100000 €
- District: Psie Pole
- Description: Justification
The aim of the project is to create an attractive urban space, improve plant diversity, and protect beneficial pollinating insects.
The project concerns four locations: the main one at pl. Wróblewskiego and three smaller ones (Wyspa Słodowa, Pomorska, Gajowicka), where we plan to create an unusual, green enclave.
As part of the development of areas with a total area of almost 12,000 m2, it is planned to plant suitable flowering vegetation, whose blooming period would allow for constant access to pollination for insects and would make this place more attractive during the spring-summer and autumn periods (shrubs are also planned, which diversify the terrain especially in winter). This would allow for the preservation of greenery diversity, and would initiate the protection of valuable pollinating insects in urban spaces, including honey bees, which are dying at an alarming rate, leading to a lack of plant and product diversity.
In developing the project, I collaborated with students from the Student Scientific Circle of Beekeepers ""Apis"" at the University of Environmental and Life Sciences in Wrocław. Their expert knowledge of plants and insects would help in creating honey meadows in Wrocław. In conclusion, I would like to add that the idea is in line with Wrocław's efforts to win the title of European Green Capital in 2019.

Based on:

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Wrocław Sports Arena - Zone A
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The project envisages the creation of Zone A of the Wrocław Sports Arena located in Zakrzów.
The lack of access to diverse and universally accessible sports and recreational facilities affects a very large number of Wrocław residents. The existing places created for this purpose are overcrowded and insufficiently adapted to the expectations of our city's residents. The deficit of such infrastructure results in a significant portion of Wrocław residents giving up on physical activity. The primary goal of the Sports Arena is to fill the gap in the map of Wrocław's sports and recreational infrastructure by creating a sports center in the northeast part of the city. The layout and selection of facilities for new disciplines at the Sports Arena will make it a unique meeting place for families from all over Wrocław. The project will include:
- a beach volleyball court
- Pumptrack Entry - a track designed for beginner and intermediate cyclists. It will be built using modular technology, so that it can be expanded or reshaped in the future
- a Padel court. Padel is a combination of Squash and Tennis, an ideal family sport with a recreational character. It is not a technical sport, which allows beginner players to quickly reach a level that enables comfortable play
- Expansion of the baseball field with a concrete grandstand set behind the backstop on the left side. This investment will enhance the entire complex and emphasize its unique character.
The project has been consulted with the residents of Wrocław. It meets the needs for activating the society associated with actively spending free time outdoors. Wrocław Sports Arena will also be a venue for national sports events, which will enhance the attractiveness of the sports offer for the city's residents.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Tuscany in Wrocław: flower pots around the Wrocław Market Square.
- Cost: 350000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The aim of the project is to beautify the streets around the Wrocław Market Square by placing 100 decorative, ceramic planters with blooming flowers and 50 hanging flower baskets in the area around the Wrocław Market Square. The Old Town in Wrocław suffers from a lack of greenery, and the floral arrangements in the planters would become an impressive decoration, highlighting the beauty of the historic townhouses and contributing to the promotion of the city. The planters should be durable against temperature changes, heavy and stable, and resistant to vandalism (easy to clean).

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Present your reasoning in 5 to 8 key points, concisely.
2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **Project Theme and Cost**: The project ""Tuscany in Wrocław"" focuses on beautification and greenery, similar to other highly supported projects like ""Trees for Wrocław"" and ""Planting young trees in the area of Wrocław"". Its cost (350,000 €) is relatively moderate compared to other projects in the district, which could make it more appealing to voters.

2. **District Voting Trends**: Krzyki district has shown strong support for projects with a focus on community and environmental enhancement. The average votes for projects in this district are higher than in other districts, indicating a potentially higher voter turnout for such initiatives.

3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Projects with similar themes, such as ""Playground for Older Children in Grabiszyński Park and Something Extra for Toddlers"" and ""Planting young trees in the area of Wrocław"", received substantial votes, suggesting a positive reception for green and communal projects.

4. **Cost-to-Vote Ratio**: Lower-cost projects tend to have a better cost-to-vote efficiency, which could work in favor of ""Tuscany in Wrocław"" given its cost is lower than many other projects while still aiming to significantly impact the community aesthetic.

5. **Historical Data and Ranking**: Analyzing the votes and rankings of similar projects, it's reasonable to estimate that ""Tuscany in Wrocław"" could attract a significant number of votes, potentially placing it within the top 10, but competition with higher-cost, high-impact projects might keep it out of the top 5.

6. **Voter Engagement and Project Appeal**: The project's focus on enhancing the historic center could resonate well with both local residents and businesses, potentially increasing its vote count.

7. **Estimation and Confidence Interval**: Based on the analysis, a rough estimate of votes could be around 5000 to 7000, considering the project's appeal, cost, and district voting behavior. The confidence interval is set slightly wider to account for variables like voter turnout and competing project appeals.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Network of parks in Wrocław - Psie Pole - Zawidawie 1
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Fabryczna
- Description: Justification
The aim of the project is to create two green areas in the Psie Pole-Zawidawie district - the development of a neglected plot in the LZN area located between Gorlicka Street and Kiełczowska Street, and a recreational area on Zakrzowie on the bank of the Dobra River. Connecting areas located on both sides of Sobieski Avenue aims to activate residents of the entire estate around a common project within the framework of WBO 2017.
The first area in this project is a neglected green plot stretching between the estate at Miłostowska Street, LZN, and the estate at Gorlicka Street. An illuminated bicycle path should be led along its inner or outer edge. In the rows of newly planted trees, there will be a place for recreation and play for the youngest children. It is also important to develop the ""wedge"" from Kiełczowska Street to the end of the LZN fence. This place is easily accessible by a sidewalk built as part of WBO. The reported project also includes the development of the space between the sidewalk and the LZN fence. Along the length of the concrete fence, paving with blocks, and along the length of the metal fence and ""island,"" appropriately selected greenery.
The second location of this project is the area on Zakrzowie, along the bank of the Dobra – from Zakrzowski Bridge to the unpaved road leading to Zakrzów Stadium. An ideal place for a proper path and family relaxation time, e.g., picnics. It is necessary to tidy up the area, designate avenues, build a shelter/s, two or three fire pits, and benches around them.
The beneficiaries will be residents of the surrounding estates, but through the development of a network park, in the future, all Wrocław residents as well.
The project was created as a result of the work of the WBO 2017 Working Group and meetings within the Civic Laboratory in Zawidawie in 2017.

- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.

}
Before giving your answer, take time to reason thoroughly, but only explain the essential reasoning.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Present your reasoning in 5 to 8 key points, concisely.
2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **Project Theme and Popularity**: The project ""Bike Wrocław 2017"" focuses on improving cycling infrastructure, a theme that has shown popularity in previous elections. Similar projects like ""Green cycling and walking ring road of Wrocław"" and ""Bike-friendly Wrocław 2016"" received substantial votes, indicating a strong community interest in cycling-related initiatives.

2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: The project cost is 1,000,000 €, which is a significant amount but consistent with other high-ranking projects from the previous year. This cost does not deter high votes as seen with other million-euro projects.

3. **District Voting Trends**: Stare Miasto had projects with a wide range of votes in the previous election, but none exceeded 4000 votes. The district's average vote count was lower compared to others like Krzyki and Fabryczna.

4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: The ""Green cycling and walking ring road of Wrocław"" in Krzyki received 12348 votes, suggesting high potential for similar projects. However, the district difference (Krzyki vs. Stare Miasto) might influence the voting outcome due to different local priorities or population densities.

5. **Voter Engagement and Project Count**: With 50 projects in the upcoming election and 67103 voters, the competition for votes will be intense. The average votes per project might decrease due to the higher number of choices.

6. **Historical Data and Ranking Estimation**: Projects similar in theme and cost in more active districts ranked within the top 10. Given the lower average engagement in Stare Miasto, a top 10 finish is optimistic but plausible.

7. **Confidence Interval Consideration**: Based on the variability seen in similar projects and the district's historical performance, a broad confidence interval is appropriate to account for uncertainties in voter behavior and the influence of competing projects.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Bike and stroller ramp at the exit from Sopocka Street to the Odra River Embankments
- Cost: 50000 €
- District: Fabryczna
- Description: Justification
The embankments along the Oder, especially the section between the Warsaw Bridges and the Szczytnicki Bridge after the completed revitalization, have become a wonderful place for walks and bike rides.
The aim of the project is to construct a ramp from Sopocka Street, which will allow free access to the cycling and walking paths for residents.
Currently, accessing the cycling and walking paths on the embankments from Sopocka Street is difficult for cyclists, disabled people, and mothers with children due to the lack of a convenient ramp: there are only steep and difficult-to-climb stairs.
Moreover, this passage is very frequently used not only by local residents but also by visitors to the St. Lawrence Cemetery and those traveling to the nearby allotment gardens on Bujwida Street.
Furthermore, the project aligns with the concept of promoting cycling in Wrocław and restoring the river to the city, and is a natural continuation of the recently completed construction of a bicycle passage under the Szczytnicki Bridge.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

This could make it more appealing to voters who prefer cost-effective initiatives.

2. **District Voting History**: In the district of Fabryczna, projects related to greenery and outdoor activities have historically received substantial support, as seen with ""Trees for Wrocław"" and ""Unity Park"". This suggests a positive inclination towards projects enhancing outdoor and recreational facilities.

3. **Similar Projects' Performance**: Similar projects focusing on cycling and pedestrian improvements have garnered moderate to high support, such as the ""Bicycle connection between the Main Station and Social Square"" with 3099 votes. This indicates a community interest in such infrastructure.

4. **Voter Engagement and Project Ranking**: Given the project's low cost and alignment with community interests, it is likely to attract a significant number of votes. However, the total number of votes might not reach the highest levels observed in 2016 due to its more localized impact.

5. **Competition and Budget Constraints**: With a total of 50 projects and a budget of 4,500,000 €, the competition for funding will be intense. However, the low cost of this project increases its chances of being funded after higher-cost projects are considered.

6. **Estimation and Confidence Interval**: Based on similar projects and district preferences, an estimated vote count can be projected with a reasonable confidence interval. The project's appeal and low cost suggest it could perform better than median projects but might not reach the top-tier vote counts.

7. **Ranking and Top Positions**: The project is likely to rank well due to its relevance and cost-effectiveness but may not break into the top 5, considering the historical data where top projects had significantly higher costs and broader appeal.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Sporty Amber
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
In executing the project for the construction of a multifunctional sports field from WBO 2014, we noticed an increase in the sporting potential among the residents of this area; there is hardly an hour when the field built in 2015 is free. Therefore, we decided to expand the sports facilities for the residents of this area by applying for:
a) the construction of a multifunctional field with lines for playing handball, two basketball courts, and a volleyball court at the intersection of Jantarowa and Zaporoska streets on the current premises of LO VIII. The field should have a polyurethane surface and be surrounded by ball catchers.
b) the replacement of the fence along the current Liceum nr VIII and Gimnazjum nr 30, which will become one institution in the future, along with the placement of gates in locations where residents already cross the fence, facilitating entry for all residents.
c) along the inner part of the fence, we propose planting shrubs to reduce the number of people crossing the fences in the future.
d) on the side of Krucza Street, near the field built in 2015, we propose the construction of an outdoor gym adapted for the needs of adults and the elderly.
e) the installation of lighting for sports fields using both solar technology and an SMS-based lighting activation system.
Additionally, we propose the renovation of the sidewalk along Jantarowa Street.
The implementation of the project will increase the attractiveness of the sports base of the estate, enhance the aesthetics of the estate by increasing the existing greenery, and improve the safety of pedestrians moving along Jantarowa.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Boarding at level - construction of Górnicki's Viennese stops
- Cost: 500000 €
- District: Śródmieście
- Description: Justification
Vienna-style stops facilitate boarding for the elderly, disabled, and parents with strollers, and ensure that drivers adhere to speed limits. This solution is increasingly being implemented in the city, including on Hubskiej, Glinianej, Trzebnickiej, and Szczytnickiej streets. The Kleczkowska stop is used by many clients of the nearby Social Insurance Institution (ZUS)—the elderly and disabled, and the elevated entrance greatly facilitates their use of public transport. The Górnickiego stop is located on the busy Sienkiewicza street. Constructing a boarding island will also improve passenger safety.

At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **Project Cost and Appeal**: The project ""Boarding at level - construction of Górnicki's Viennese stops"" has a moderate cost of 500,000 €, which is lower than many other projects in the district and could be seen as financially feasible. The project addresses accessibility, which is a significant concern in urban areas and could attract votes from those interested in social welfare and urban mobility improvements.

2. **District Voting Trends**: In the district of Śródmieście, the average number of votes for projects in 2016 was relatively low compared to other districts. However, the project ""Bike-friendly Wrocław 2016"" in the same district received a high number of votes (4799), indicating that transportation-related projects can perform well.

3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects concerning transportation infrastructure and accessibility (like raising platform surfaces) received a moderate number of votes, suggesting a consistent but not overwhelming interest in such projects.

4. **Social Impact**: The project targets a broad audience, including the elderly, disabled, and parents with strollers, which could enhance its appeal. Projects with a clear social benefit tend to attract more community support.

5. **Project Visibility and Necessity**: The project's focus on a busy street and its aim to improve safety and accessibility could make it more visible and perceived as necessary by the voters, potentially increasing its appeal.

6. **Historical Data and Ranking Estimation**: Based on the votes received by similar projects and considering the moderate cost, the project is likely to receive a good number of votes but may not top the list due to its specific focus compared to more universally appealing projects like green spaces or broad infrastructural improvements.

7. **Budget Constraints and Ranking**: Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it is feasible to be funded if it receives enough votes. Projects with costs around 500,000 € have historically been able to secure funding if they rank within the top 15.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Green running-walking-cycling trail from Ołtaszyn to the center (with modifications)
- Cost: 750000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
I propose several modifications (mainly cost-reducing) to this project so that it is feasible and fits within the planned budget:
1. The route passes through several districts (originally 3) and for this reason, I classify this project as city-wide with a higher budget.
2. Shortening the route - running from the renovated Parafialna Street through Orawska and Spiska to Skowroni Park. Only if further financing is obtained or larger funds are utilized, do I propose extending it through Spiska Street to the Aquapark or further.
3. Replacing the asphalt surface with a smooth, compacted gravel surface. This change:
a) lowers costs
b) is healthier and more comfortable for runners and equivalent for cyclists
c) allows car drivers access to allotment gardens while simultaneously reducing the speed of access compared to an asphalt road, thereby improving the safety of pedestrians, runners, and cyclists.
d) maintains the recreational character of the path in terms of physical activity for pedestrians, runners, and cyclists without turning it into an asphalt, congested access road and a shortcut and alternative route for cars for the congested Grota-Roweckiego Street.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **Project Theme and Popularity**: The proposed project, a green running-walking-cycling trail, aligns with previously popular projects in Krzyki, such as the ""Green cycling and walking ring road of Wrocław"" which received 12348 votes. This suggests a strong community interest in green, recreational infrastructure.

2. **Cost and Budget Considerations**: The project's cost is 750,000 €, which is moderate compared to other projects in the district. This cost is similar to other moderately successful projects like the ""Improvement of the Bogedaina Street surface"" and ""Extension of the left-turn lane towards Lotnicza Street"", which received 983 and 2901 votes respectively.

3. **District Voting Trends**: Krzyki has shown a propensity to support higher-cost projects, and the average votes for projects in this district are higher than in other districts. This could favor the new project, given its ecological and recreational appeal.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: The project's cost and theme are similar to the ""Completion of the pedestrian and bicycle route around Wielka Wyspa"" which ranked 15th with 2260 votes. However, the new project's modifications for cost reduction and enhanced accessibility might give it an edge.

5. **Voter Engagement and Project Scope**: The project's modifications to make it more budget-friendly and its appeal as a multi-use trail could attract a broader voter base, potentially increasing its votes beyond similar projects.

6. **Statistical Estimation**: Based on the votes of similar projects and considering the modifications that might increase appeal, the project could be estimated to receive around 3000 to 4000 votes. This estimation considers the popularity of green infrastructure projects in Krzyki and the moderate cost.

7. **Ranking and Top Positions**: Given the estimated votes and the historical data where projects with around 3000 votes ranked around 10th to 15th, the new project might rank similarly. However, its broad appeal could push it closer to the top 10.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Green Promenade through Krzyki Stage I
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
The project aims to restore the historical urban layout by revalorizing the promenade stretching from the intersection of Zaporoska and Grabiszyńska streets, crowned with the historic water tower at Aleja Wiśniowa. We propose to reclaim the aesthetic values of the original green artery concept, combined with the communication needs of this part of the district. The street, outlined in the late 19th century, is an example of a beautiful visual axis dominated by the water tower from 1904, a monument to good urban planning, additionally serving as a green corridor of the area. With minimal resources, we can restore the luster of the former promenade while organizing and improving pedestrian, vehicular, and bicycle traffic on this section. The work performed could potentially mark the beginning of further changes towards Grabiszyńska Street. The primary task of the project is to improve the aesthetics of the area, the quality of life of the residents, and to connect a convenient pedestrian and bicycle route along the entire section of the green artery from landmarks such as the water tower and the Jewish Hospital, now housing the Railway Hospital, further to the Roman Catholic Parish of St. Augustine, Hans Poelzig's tenements, up to the Rondo of the Silesian Insurgents.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Lounger - a wandering piece of furniture for rest and play
- Cost: 150000 €
- District: Śródmieście
- Description: Justification
The ""Polegiwacz"" is a portable furniture-installation designed for relaxation, fun, and social integration. The prototype of this facility operated over the past three seasons in two different locations in Wrocław: in Słowacki Park and near the Zwierzyniecka Footbridge. Three seasons have shown that the furniture is eagerly used by various age and social groups. The facility hosted many events, concerts, meetings, classes, and even at least one wedding session. Contrary to its name, children used it not for lounging but as an attractive playground.

The location planned for the first season - Polskie Hill - was chosen as a distinctive point along the walking route of Wrocław's promenades. The proximity to the newly opened X. Dunikowski Boulevard attracts many residents and visitors - including many families. Last year's observations and analyses showed that an element that could complement the local program is a playground for children (the nearest playgrounds are on Bielarska Island and near the Puppet Theatre) who often get bored during walks and use existing landscaping elements for play.

The ""Polegiwacz"" on Polskie Hill would excellently combine the possibility of relaxation for the older with the opportunity for activity for the youngest.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Bees in the city – pollinator hotels with a resting area between Hermanowska and Chociebuska streets
- Cost: 250000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
Currently, the indicated park, although well-maintained, does not serve a recreational or communicative function. Overgrown with old trees (including honey-producing ones), and crisscrossed by worn paths, the area invites organization and the creation of alleys that would connect Kuźniki with Gądów Mały, the establishment of a thematic flower meadow that would benefit beneficial insects, and through the installation of deck chairs and comfortable benches, it would become a place of rest for residents of nearby estates. To diversify the park, I propose the installation of about 20 beehives along with bee families. The area is safely distant from the nearest houses, so the insects would not pose a threat to the residents. The maintenance of the beehives would be handled by specialized units such as beekeeping clubs, and the delicious Kuźnicki Honey would be auctioned at the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity.

At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **District Voting Trends**: Krzyki district has historically shown strong voter turnout and support for projects, with an average of 3055.82 votes per project in 2016. This suggests a generally high level of engagement and competition within the district.

2. **Project Cost and Appeal**: The proposed project ""Bees in the city"" has a relatively low cost (250,000 €) compared to other projects in the same district, which could make it more appealing to voters who prefer cost-effective initiatives. Additionally, the ecological and recreational nature of the project aligns with popular themes such as urban greenery and sustainability.

3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in terms of theme and district have received a moderate number of votes. For instance, ""Urban Green Islands"" in Stare Miasto, also priced at 250,000 €, received 990 votes. This suggests that smaller-scale ecological projects can attract a decent amount of attention.

4. **Voter Distribution and Project Count**: With 18 projects in Krzyki this year, votes will be distributed among more options, which might affect the total votes any single project receives. However, the unique appeal of the ""Bees in the city"" project could help it stand out.

5. **Historical Data and Ranking**: Analyzing the 2016 data, projects in the top 10 received votes ranging from 2260 to 13938. Given the unique nature and moderate cost of the ""Bees in the city"" project, it is likely to attract a significant number of votes but may not reach the very top due to the high competition in Krzyki.

6. **Estimation and Confidence Interval**: Based on similar projects and the average voting pattern in Krzyki, an estimated vote count can be cautiously placed around the lower to mid-range of historical data for similar projects. A confidence interval can be derived considering possible variations in voter turnout and interest in ecological projects.

7. **Rank and Top Positions**: Given the competitive nature of Krzyki and the number of projects, it is less likely that ""Bees in the city"" will be in the top 5, but it has a reasonable chance to make it into the top 10, especially considering its appeal and cost-effectiveness.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: The base of little astronauts, or the cosmic playground in Mini Park on F. Hynka Street.
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
As part of the Civic Budget of 2015, the indicated plot was organized and now encourages the development of a section for the youngest residents of the Kosmonautów Estate.
The base of little astronauts is a modern playground complex that will fulfill children's dreams of being astronauts and traveling to distant planets and galaxies. The base is designed to prepare little astronauts for space journeys, simultaneously developing their motor skills and imagination. The complex includes: a large space station, a training base, the Mercury agility set, and the Cosmic Surfer. These devices feature, among others, a group of linear obstacles, climbing walls, towers of various heights, tunnels, slides, and ladders, as well as a cosmic device designer. These devices are classified as difficult-to-access equipment, intended for school-aged children.
For the youngest children, a smaller cosmic set is planned, including dragonfly-type swings, pendulum swings, and rockers. There will also be a sandbox, benches, and drawing boards as perfect complementary elements of the playground, allowing children to demonstrate their artistic talents. The entire area designated for the playground should be fenced. Due to the lack of a local spatial development plan, it is worth analyzing the reclassification of the above area from a building plot to a plot designated for park greenery.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Cleaning of the sandstone medallions with the coat of arms of Wrocław from war-time grime and soot on old school buildings, hospitals, and other public buildings.
- Cost: 150000 €
- District: Krzyki
- Description: Justification
Medallions with the coat of arms of Wrocław are unique in the country - cleaned of wartime soot and dirt, they serve as decoration and a tourist attraction, for example, two cleaned medallions on the facade of the Market Hall, a cleaned medallion on the building of the Primary School at Kleczkowska Street, the facade of the Ninth High School, the building of the First High School at Poniatowskiego Street. The proposal involves sandblasting these medallions with pressurized water from a boom lift. The cost is about several thousand złoty per piece, but cleaning 10 pieces would be cheaper.
Known addresses of these gems:
> MSWiA Hospital from Pl. Powstańców Wlkp. and from the railway tracks - 2 pieces
> Post-secondary School for Cultural Animator Training, Building A from J. Niemcewicza Street
> University of Wrocław - three buildings on Dawida Street - 3 pieces
> Primary School No. 73, Gliniana Street on the side from Gajowa Street.

2. **District Voting Trends**: Krzyki is a district with a high average number of votes per project (3055.82 in 2016). Projects in this district tend to receive substantial support, especially those with practical or aesthetic benefits to the community.

3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: The project's cost and theme are somewhat similar to the ""Bouldering wall"" project (also 150,000 €, Krzyki), which received 648 votes and ranked 38th. However, the cultural and historical significance of cleaning medallions might attract more interest.

4. **Historical and Cultural Significance**: The project emphasizes the restoration of historical and cultural symbols, which could resonate well with residents who value heritage and aesthetics, potentially drawing more votes than purely recreational projects.

5. **Voter Engagement and Project Visibility**: The project's success will depend on how effectively it is marketed and its visibility among voters. Projects with a clear, tangible benefit or those that enhance the city's beauty or functionality tend to perform well.

6. **Estimation of Votes and Ranking**: Given the project's lower cost, cultural significance, and the voting trends in Krzyki, it is estimated to perform better than the lowest-ranked projects but may not reach the popularity of the highest-ranked ones due to its niche appeal.

7. **Top 5 and Top 10 Potential**: Considering the strong performance of higher-budget projects in Krzyki and the specific appeal of this project, it is less likely to be in the top 5 but could approach the lower end of the top 10, depending on voter turnout and campaign effectiveness.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Neptune's Fountain at Nowy Targ Square
- Cost: 1000000 €
- District: Śródmieście
- Description: Justification
The reconstruction of the historical Neptune sculpture at Nowy Targ Square, destroyed during World War II. In its current form, the square lacks a central point that completes the composition. The dark surfaces of which the square is built accumulate heat during hot days, and the fountain would also prevent this, which would also improve user comfort. One could consider holding a competition for a contemporary, figurative version of Neptune inspired by the historical sculpture.
The project would be divided into stages. This stage would only include the cost of starting the carving of the fountain, and the second stage would involve the construction of the entire basin and the necessary infrastructure.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Present your reasoning in 5 to 8 key points, concisely.
2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **Historical Context and Popularity**: The project ""Neptune's Fountain at Nowy Targ Square"" was previously proposed in 2016 with a slightly lower cost (750,000 €) and received 3632 votes, ranking 9th. This indicates a moderate level of support for culturally significant and aesthetic projects in Wrocław.

2. **District Voting Patterns**: In the district of Śródmieście, the most-voted project in 2016 was ""Bike-friendly Wrocław 2016"" with 4799 votes. This suggests that while the district supports high-cost projects, the preference might lean slightly more towards utility over purely aesthetic enhancements.

3. **Project Cost and Budget Constraints**: The project cost is 1,000,000 €, which is significant. Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it will need a high number of votes to be considered for funding, as seen with other million-euro projects.

4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar aesthetic or cultural projects across different districts received a wide range of votes, but none exceeded the votes for the bike project in Śródmieście. This suggests that while there is interest, it may not surpass the most practical projects.

5. **Increased Cost Impact**: The increase in cost from 750,000 € in 2016 to 1,000,000 € in the current proposal might affect its attractiveness to voters, especially if they are budget-conscious and comparing utility versus aesthetic value.

6. **Estimation and Confidence Interval**: Based on the previous votes for the same project and adjusting for the slight increase in cost and potential voter behavior changes, an estimated vote count can be projected with a realistic confidence interval.

7. **Ranking and Top Positions**: Considering the historical data and the nature of other projects, it's likely that this project will rank within the top 15 but breaking into the top 5 might be challenging unless there's a significant shift in voter interest towards cultural revitalization post-pandemic.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Let's connect Psie Pole and Zakrzów – a pedestrian and bicycle link
- Cost: 350000 €
- District: Stare Miasto
- Description: Justification
The project envisages the construction of a pedestrian and bicycle route connecting Kiełczowska Street with Bierutowska, Dobroszycka, Armii Ludowej Streets, and the Wrocław Psie Pole train station. This route will allow the residents of Psie Pole to quickly reach the train or the clinic on Bierutowska Street on foot or by bicycle, and the residents of Zakrzów through Armii Ludowej Street to the LZN area. In this way, we will facilitate the movement between two Wrocław housing estates, which are close to each other but have been separated by the railway line and industrial areas.

Every day, many people, mainly on bicycles, move along a muddy, gravel path between the remnants of allotment gardens and industrial areas. In the local spatial development plan, a narrow strip connecting Kiełczowska Street with Bierutowska is marked as an internal road. The width of the land strip (from 5 to 6 m) does not allow for the construction of a street of greater significance for intra-estate communication. Therefore, I propose to develop this piece of space differently – to build a comfortable route for pedestrians and cyclists hidden in the shade of trees that have already grown there.

Route parameters: width 3 m, asphalt surface
Route components:
•	pedestrian and bicycle path Kiełczowska – Bierutowska
•	renovation of the sidewalk at Bierutowska Street
•	pedestrian crossing and bicycle crossing through Bierutowska Street with a refuge in the roadway and additional lighting
•	pedestrian and bicycle path Bierutowska – Dobroszycka (under the viaduct along Jan III Sobieski Avenue)
•	pedestrian crossing and bicycle crossing through Dobroszycka Street with additional lighting
•	renovation of the sidewalk at Dobroszycka Street along with a pedestrian crossing and bicycle crossing through Armii Ludowej Street (at the railway crossing) and additional lighting

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, in which **50 projects** have been proposed.

**Project to analyze::**
- Name: Bus stop infrastructure on Dworcowa Street
- Cost: 420000 €
- District: Stare Miasto
- Description: Justification
The bus loop at Dworcowa Street (from which, among other destinations, buses depart to the airport) is in very poor condition with old stops, a limited number of benches, and a sidewalk surface in bad shape (uneven concrete slabs that are very uncomfortable to walk on, especially in winter). Additionally, the bus schedules are very unclear as they are divided among individual stops, making it difficult for someone not from Wrocław to navigate. This place creates an unfavorable image of the city, and a large number of people arriving in Wrocław (including tourists) come into contact with it, especially when someone arrives in Wrocław using public transport to get to the airport.
It would suffice to replace the sidewalk surface, refresh or install new bus shelters (3-4), possibly trash bins, install benches, refresh or replace the bus stop poles, and possibly add 2-3 new street lamps.
I classify this project as city-wide, as it is used by a large portion of Wrocław's residents and visitors, and this place influences the image and perception of the city.

Based on:
- The voting dynamics observed in 2016.
- The cost, district, and theme of the project.
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context of Wroclaw.

2. **District Voting Trends**: In Stare Miasto, projects with a focus on public infrastructure and transportation have received a moderate level of support. For instance, the ""Neptune's Fountain at Nowy Targ Square"" received 3632 votes, while smaller projects like ""Benches at the Stops"" garnered 831 votes.
