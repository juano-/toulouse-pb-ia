263;590;1;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives on the official website. A total of 4,532 people voted in the 2022 election..

Once the voting period ends, the projects are ranked according to the number of votes received. The winning projects are then selected using a greedy algorithm: starting with the project that received the most votes, projects are successively added in order of votes, as long as the available budget allows. 

When the remaining budget is not sufficient to fund the next project on the list, the algorithm skips to the next one that can be funded, and so on, until the total budget of 8,000,000 euros is exhausted.

Your task is to analyze the following project, proposed as part of a new participatory budgeting election in year 2024.

Project: Increase the number of bicycle parking spaces in the city center
Cost: 12000.0 â‚¬
District: 1 - Capitole / Arnaud Bernard / Carmes
Description: Even though notable efforts have already been made, wanting to develop the modal share of bicycles in transportation requires a significant increase in bike parking options, especially in the city center. Parking spaces are very insufficient around Capitole Square, Wilson Square, St Pierre Square, Arnaud Bernard Square, around St Sernin, Carnot Boulevard, Strasbourg Boulevard, Arcole Boulevard, Alsace-Lorraine Street, Mirepoix Street, PargaminiÃ¨res Street, RÃ©musat Street, Taur Street, Gambetta Street, etc. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: As part of its urban development projects, the Community systematically integrates fixtures for bike parking. The deployment of urban furniture such as bike racks in the city center is carried out according to the needs reported by local residents and users (requests to the District Mayor or the AlloToulouse platform 05 61 222 222), subject to the opinion of the Architecte des BÃ¢timents de France and the availability of already very constrained public space. Within this framework, it is proposed to install, at a minimum, fifty bike racks per year in District 1.

Project: Creation of a contraflow bike lane on Bertrand de Born street (section Canal du Midi / Place Belfort)
Cost: 60000.0 â‚¬
District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
Description: I propose the greening and the establishment of a bicycle lane on Bertrand de Born street. This project, in adaptation to climate change, includes: - eco-mobility with the bicycle lane and the removal of parking spaces. Moreover, the presence of 5 private and 3 public parking lots meets the needs of the residents - the creation of green islands (without affecting the networks) is part of nature in the city and biodiversity: creating shade for the summer. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The development of a bicycle lane from the Canal du Midi to Place Belfort can be considered. Such a project would remove about 34 parking spaces, 2 delivery spots, 1 space for Persons with Reduced Mobility, and bicycle parking. The terrace area of an establishment would also need to be modified. However, the greening of the street cannot be considered due to the presence of numerous networks: their diversion requires a budget incompatible with that allocated under this participatory budget. Finally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be proposed to residents to green this street. This initiative, after agreement from the concerned property owners, is subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and pedestrian continuity to be respected. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the technical services of the city hall and the metropolis, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

Project: Pedestrians, bicycles, and buses on Boulevard Riquet
Cost: 250000.0 â‚¬
District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
Description: Calming of Boulevard Riquet by separating uses through the creation of (1) a dedicated bus lane; (2) a bicycle lane (isolated track replacing a car lane on the roadway, using tactical urbanism if necessary), thus separated from pedestrians (who will walk more peacefully along the Canal), as along Boulevard Monplaisir. Development to be created from the Saint-Aubin footbridge (or earlier from the Genes Lougnon barracks) to the AllÃ©es Jean-JaurÃ¨s. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: In the context of this call for ideas, given the associated deadlines and budget, it is not possible to carry out a development along the entire stretch from the Genes Lougnon barracks to the AllÃ©es Jean-JaurÃ¨s. However, pending the implementation of the Grand Parc Canal project, which aims to reorganize and secure movements along the canals (pedestrians, cyclists, public transport, cars), and in order to already improve the conflicts of use along the canal and thus the movements of pedestrians, punctual interventions can be considered at the most sensitive spots that will have been previously defined. Also, between the Constantine Bridge and the Riquet Bridge, the development of a one-way bicycle lane could be studied: note that such a development would eliminate about 45 parking spaces.

Project: Massive Greening on Raymond IV Street
Cost: 200000.0 â‚¬
District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
Description: Raymond IV Street is 14 meters wide and currently lacks any greenery. To mitigate the extreme heat on this street during summer, it would be interesting to replace parking spaces with planting pits to accommodate large trees along the entire length of the street, thereby creating a true canopy. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Planting (14/15 trees) in parking spaces may be considered on the odd-numbered side, subject to the approval of the architect of the buildings of France. On the even-numbered side, the presence of numerous networks does not allow for the creation of pits to accommodate trees. This project would eliminate about 15 parking spaces. On the occasion of this redevelopment, the implementation of a bicycle lane on the even-numbered side can also be studied. Finally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green this street. This initiative, after agreement from the concerned owners, is subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and pedestrian continuity to be respected. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the technical services of the city hall and the metropolis, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

This could attract votes from environmentally conscious residents and those favoring non-car transportation.

- **District Characteristics**: The project is located in District 3, which includes diverse neighborhoods. The impact of losing parking spaces might be a concern for some voters, potentially reducing the project's appeal to car-dependent residents.

- **Cost and Budget Constraints**: With a cost of 200,000 euros, the project is moderately priced within the typical range of participatory budgeting projects. This makes it more likely to be funded within the 8,000,000 euros total budget, assuming it garners enough votes.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Given that each voter can select up to three projects, projects with broad appeal and visible impact often receive higher votes. The environmental focus of this project could place it in the mid to high range of popularity.

- **Historical Voting Patterns**: Projects that address immediate and visible concerns like heat mitigation during summer tend to perform well. However, the removal of parking could be a contentious issue, potentially affecting its overall vote count.

- **Competition**: The number of competing projects and their themes will also influence the ranking. If there are many high-impact or lower-cost projects, it could push this project lower in the final ranking.

Project: Greening of the entire Rue des Fontaines
Cost: 250000.0 â‚¬
District: 6 - Saint-Cyprien
Description: Objective of revitalizing the street. Making the street more pleasant, conducive to the presence of life, and contributing to the thermal regulation of the neighborhood (micro-climatic rebalancing). A few simple proposals, whose effectiveness is well established, include: Tree planting and vegetation through adapted strata. De-impermeabilization and reduction of car parking spaces. Biological reactivation of targeted soils. Increase in bicycle parking spaces. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is accepted, subject to feasibility in view of the presence of underground networks. Similarly, the form that this greening will take will be specified according to the constraints of the networks: tree planting, planters with climbing plants on supports, or standard-formed trees. These developments will result in the removal of about 17 car parking spaces. This project will also be submitted for review by the Architecte des BÃ¢timents de France. Additionally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green these streets. However, the agreement of each owner is mandatory to green their front facade. The owner must also commit to maintaining the pits over the long term. Moreover, this initiative will be subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and the need to maintain pedestrian continuity. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the city and metropolitan technical services. More information at: https://metropole.toulouse.fr/actualites/des-fleurs-sur-mon-mur

";"- **Project Appeal and Relevance**: The project focuses on environmental sustainability and urban living quality, which are generally popular themes among urban voters, especially in a city like Toulouse that values green spaces and sustainable urban development.
  
- **District Characteristics**: District 6 - Saint-Cyprien is a vibrant and densely populated area. Projects that aim to improve living conditions and environmental quality in such districts tend to attract a good number of votes due to the direct impact on residents' daily lives.

- **Cost vs. Budget**: The project cost of 250,000 euros is relatively moderate when compared to the total available budget of 8,000,000 euros. This makes it more likely to be funded without exhausting the budget, allowing it to compete effectively against more expensive projects.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Based on previous participatory budgeting elections, projects that enhance community spaces and environmental conditions tend to perform well. The ability to vote for up to 3 projects per voter also increases the likelihood of this project receiving votes, as voters can support multiple initiatives without prioritizing one over another.

- **Technical and Regulatory Feasibility**: The project has been accepted subject to feasibility, which might introduce some uncertainty. However, the detailed planning and the involvement of the Architecte des BÃ¢timents de France suggest a serious proposal that can sway voters looking for well-thought-out projects.

- **Social Impact**: The reduction of car parking spaces might be seen as a negative by some voters who rely on car transportation, potentially affecting the number of votes. However, the increase in bicycle parking spaces and overall greening can be viewed positively by environmentally conscious voters.

- **Historical Data and Estimation**: Without specific historical voting data for similar projects, estimating the exact number of votes is challenging. However, considering the factors above, a reasonable estimate can be made based on the project's appeal, cost, and social impact.

Project: Skate park renovation and development of communal lands along the railway track
Cost: 250000.0 â‚¬
District: 9 - Trois Cocus / Borderouge / Croix-Daurade / PalÃ©ficat / Grand Selve
Description: Since the abandonment of the Biomass power plant project, the lands owned by the city hall along the railway and Ernest Renan Street have been neglected. A comprehensive redevelopment project into quality green or sports spaces for the residents of the neighborhood would be a real added value. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: This idea is somewhat similar to idea 7297, which involves enhancing the sports facilities on Ernest Renan Street. However, it proposes a redevelopment of the existing structures with the creation of a quality green space, not the creation of a pumptrack. Skate park renovation: 200,000.00 including tax + development of the surroundings: 50,000.00 including tax.

Project: Installation of shade structures over the children's play area at La Maourine
Cost: 120000.0 â‚¬
District: 9 - Trois Cocus / Borderouge / Croix-Daurade / PalÃ©ficat / Grand Selve
Description: The playgrounds in Parc de la Maourine are very exposed to the sun. The idea would be to install shade structures above the play equipment, especially the slides, so that they can be used all day long in summer. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal is to install wind-resistant shade structures as has already been done in other playgrounds (Borderouge). At Maourine, given the layout of the playground which includes a significant variety of different modules, a single shade structure will not suffice. Given the investment, the quote will allow for a precise refinement of the potential coverage area.

Project: Installation of uritrottoirs in the Belfort/Bayard district
Cost: 8000.0 â‚¬
District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
Description: Implement Uritrottoirs in the streets around Belfort Square/rue Bayard (near the bars) to avoid persistent odors and to collect urine in planters to make our streets more pleasant. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Such equipment is already in operation near Belfort Square, at 1 rue de lâ€™Orient. Note that the installation of a Uritrottoir is subject to various constraints: not overly restricting the width of the sidewalk, no underground networks... The notion of acceptability with the residents must also be considered (directly opposite the device, at the corner of streets which could surprise a passerby...). Therefore, locations near schools are to be excluded. For the mentioned area, the corners of Guillemin Tarayre and Agathoise streets as well as Laffite/Bertrand de Born streets are among the pre-identified sites.

Project: Arrange traffic on the GuilhemÃ©ry Bridge for pedestrians and cyclists
Cost: 150000.0 â‚¬
District: 11 - Bonhoure / GuilhemÃ©ry / ChÃ¢teau de l'Hers / Limayrac / CÃ´te PavÃ©e
Description: Near a large educational institution, this complex and densely frequented intersection is designed only for cars. However, it is also heavily used by pedestrians and bicycles. Currently, due to the lack of clearly defined cycling facilities (as on the Pont Montaudran), sidewalks are increasingly being used by two-wheelers. Let's delineate and secure spaces, so that everyone can move safely, which will also encourage cycling in the city. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A study for a minor reconfiguration of this bridge is underway as part of the project to convert Port Saint Etienne to Grand Rond to two-way traffic, accompanying phase 2 of the civil engineering works (mid-2025 to mid-2026) for the future FranÃ§ois Verdier line C station. This will result in a dead end on Rue des FrÃ¨res Lion. This idea will therefore be part of this study aimed at improving pedestrian, bicycle, and public transport mobility, with a possible upgrade to the traffic lights standards.

Project: Greening of Rue de Cugnaux
Cost: 250000.0 â‚¬
District: 6 - Saint-Cyprien
Description: Create greening areas (like on the street leading from J Diebold space to Ravelin square) with the possibility to plant trees or set up flowers. And let the local residents maintain them! ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea of greening Cugnaux street has been accepted, provided that the presence of networks allows it. Similarly, the form that this greening will take will be refined according to the constraints of the networks: planting of trees, planters with climbing plants on supports, or standard-formed trees. These developments will result in the removal of about 17 car parking spaces. This project will also be submitted for review by the Architecte des BÃ¢timents de France. Additionally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green these streets. However, the agreement of each owner is mandatory to green their front facade. The owner must also commit to maintaining the pits in the long term. Moreover, this initiative will be subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and the need to maintain pedestrian continuity. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the city and metropolitan technical services, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

Project: Avenue de la Gloire by the cemetery wall: bringing ""life"" back to the abandoned planters
Cost: 250000.0 â‚¬
District: 10 - Jolimont / Soupetard / Roseraie / Gloire / Gramont / Amouroux
Description: The cemetery wall is lined with planters abandoned due to chronic drought. However, plants manage to grow there. The idea is to assemble a team of volunteers to plant drought-resistant species (e.g., sedum), maintain them in coordination with the technical services and according to a specification. This is in the same spirit as the teams for community composting (coordinator, training...). In the end, we will have plants in these planters rather than abandoned soil. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Considering the length of the wall, it is possible to refurbish half of the planters within the 2023 budget limit by idea for my neighborhood.

Project: Renovating Henri Russell Square: a place of life and freshness
Cost: 250000.0 â‚¬
District: 5 - Saint-Michel / Saint-Agne / Empalot / Le Busca / Ile du Ramier / Monplaisir
Description: - Reduce the presence of cars: remove car parking spaces around the square, and add bicycle parking.
- Green the square, plant trees, add a water feature, children's playgrounds, and benches.
- Review traffic along Avenue Crampel: better signal the right-of-way (or change it?), and make room for buses to turn left when exiting the square without being hindered by cars on the avenue coming from the left.
ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Such an arrangement would require the diversion of networks present on Russell Square and adapting the traffic plan.
Note that the maximum budget per project of â‚¬250,000 including taxes will not allow for a complete renovation of the square.
The project would also be subject to consultation with residents and neighborhood associations. It would also require formal approval from the Architecte des BÃ¢timents de France.

Project: Greening and tree planting on LÃ©o Lagrange Street
Cost: 250000.0 â‚¬
District: 5 - Saint-Michel / Saint-Agne / Empalot / Le Busca / Ile du Ramier / Monplaisir
Description: Greening and tree planting on LÃ©o Lagrange Street to bring a breath of oxygen and natural coolness in summer, thus allowing for better air quality in a street that serves as a passageway and transition between neighborhoods. This will also beautify a street used by schoolchildren and high school students who are sensitive to this important issue for their future. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Due to the many networks present underground, the greening of LÃ©o Lagrange Street is highly constrained. Planting a line of trees along the entire length of the street would exceed the financial envelope of the participatory budget. Therefore, it is proposed to remove the asphalt from all the parking spaces on the street, with the installation of grassed cellular paving. This would recreate soil porosity without losing any parking spaces. Additionally, trees could be planted sporadically if spaces free of networks and other constraints allow it. Furthermore, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green this street. However, the agreement of each owner is mandatory to green their front facade. The owner must also commit to maintaining the pits in the long term. Moreover, this initiative will be subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and the need to maintain pedestrian continuity. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the city and metropolitan technical services, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

Project: Stop the mosquito proliferation in Montaudran
Cost: 1000.0 â‚¬
District: 12 - Pont des Demoiselles / Ormeau / Montaudran / La Terrasse / MalepÃ¨re
Description: The proliferation of mosquitoes is a real scourge on the quality of life for us in the Toulouse neighborhood! That's why I propose experimenting with planting, in the Montaudran area: gardens along the Ligne de la Piste des GÃ©ants up to the park near the EHPAD, with plants that would be effective in naturally keeping this pest away. Types of plants: citronella - lavender - mint - eucalyptus, etc. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PROVIDE: It is important to note that, to date, there is no scientific consensus on the effectiveness of such plants in repelling mosquitoes. Additionally, mosquito control stations will be installed in the neighborhood as part of the previous participatory budget. Therefore, egg-laying traps could also be considered as an addition in Montaudran.

";"- **Local Relevance and Impact**: The project addresses a common and tangible issue (mosquito proliferation) that affects daily life in Montaudran, which could drive higher voter interest and support.
  
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: With a relatively low cost of 1000 euros, the project is highly affordable compared to other potential projects, making it more likely to be funded within the available budget.

- **Voter Behavior**: Residents tend to support projects that promise immediate and visible benefits. Mosquito control is a relatable and urgent issue, likely increasing its appeal.

- **District Coverage**: The project is located in a district that includes multiple neighborhoods, potentially affecting a larger voter base which could translate into more votes.

- **Scientific Skepticism**: The lack of scientific consensus on the effectiveness of the proposed plants for mosquito control might deter some voters, but the inclusion of proven mosquito control measures (like egg-laying traps) could mitigate this concern.

- **Previous Initiatives**: The mention of ongoing mosquito control efforts in the area might influence perceptions of this project's necessity or redundancy, potentially affecting its vote count.

- **General Voting Trends**: Based on typical participatory budgeting dynamics, projects with lower costs and high community impact often perform well in terms of votes.

";"- **Urban and Environmental Context**: The project targets a significant urban heat island, which is a pressing issue in many cities, including Toulouse. Projects that address environmental sustainability and improve quality of life tend to be popular among voters.
  
- **District Coverage**: The project is located in a district with multiple neighborhoods, potentially affecting a larger population who may feel directly impacted and thus more likely to support the initiative.

- **Project Cost**: At 250,000 euros, the project is moderately priced, which could make it more likely to be funded within the available budget of 8 million euros, compared to more expensive projects.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Historical data suggests that projects with environmental benefits and direct community impact, like greening urban spaces, generally receive favorable voter attention in participatory budgeting.

- **Comparative Analysis**: Assuming a similar distribution of votes as in previous years and considering the project's appeal and budget, it is likely to attract a significant number of votes but not be the top-voted due to competition with potentially more impactful or larger-scale projects.

- **Greedy Algorithm Impact**: The cost-effectiveness of the project (high impact for a moderate cost) will likely make it a strong candidate in the greedy algorithm selection process, assuming it garners enough votes to be considered early in the funding sequence.

";"- **Project Appeal and Relevance**: The project focuses on enhancing green transportation and recreational spaces, which are generally popular themes in urban settings. This aligns well with contemporary urban development goals and public interest in sustainability and health.

- **District Characteristics**: District 14, encompassing Saint-Simon, Lafourguette, and Oncopole-Campus SantÃ© du Futur, is a diverse area. The project's focus on connectivity and accessibility could appeal to a wide demographic, including students, healthcare professionals, and families.

- **Cost vs. Budget**: The project cost of 240,000 euros is relatively moderate within the total budget of 8 million euros. This makes it more likely to be funded without exhausting the budget, allowing for potentially more projects to be approved.

- **Voting Trends**: Based on previous participatory budgeting outcomes, projects that enhance infrastructure without causing significant disruption tend to receive favorable support. The project's non-invasive approach to enhancing existing structures could be a positive factor.

- **Competition**: The number of competing projects and their nature (cost, impact, and appeal) will significantly influence the ranking and votes. Without specific details on other projects, a conservative estimate is prudent.

- **Historical Data and Estimation**: Assuming a similar voter turnout as in 2022 (4,532 voters) and considering the project's appeal and cost, a reasonable estimate of votes might be around the lower to mid-range of total votes, factoring in the possibility of each voter selecting up to 3 projects.

Project: Redevelopment of the Roland Garros dead-end for children
Cost: 250000.0 â‚¬
District: 8 - Minimes / BarriÃ¨re de Paris / Ponts-Jumeaux / La Vache / Raisins / Fondeyre
Description: Roland-Garros Square is currently a heat island in the summer, and it suffers from significant noise pollution. Moreover, it lacks green spaces and facilities for children and their parents. Our idea for our neighborhood is to redevelop Roland Garros Square into a multisport field for children aged 10 and under, and to integrate it into a wooded, friendly, demineralized, and secure environment near the kindergarten. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Depending on additional soil studies specifically on the mineral slab, the installation of a playground complementing the existing playground could be considered: multi-use structures for ages 3 to 12 (slide, climbing games, swing, and spring games with a shade cover) + installation of a fountain + plantings. The cost estimate does not account for significant pollution cleanup or diversion of networks (stormwater and others...), â‚¬230,000, an additional â‚¬20,000 should be planned to redo the playground in the middle.

Your task is to analyze the following project, proposed as part of a new participatory budgeting election in year 2024.

Project: Enhancement and preservation of natural spaces in Sept Deniers
Cost: 50000.0 â‚¬
District: 7 - Sept Deniers / Ginestous-SesquiÃ¨res / Lalande
Description: Preserve and enhance the natural spaces in the Sept Deniers by 1. protecting them (in the PLUIH) 2. naming and indicating them (signage for pedestrians and cyclists...) to make them known and accessible to everyone 3. making known the different species present in these parks (small educational panels at the foot of the trees) 4. respecting differentiated mowing to preserve biodiversity 5. preventing cars from parking there ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Differentiated mowing is applied city-wide as part of the policy for differentiated management of green spaces. Many areas are thus left with tall grasses and mowed late to respect biodiversity. Differentiated management also takes into account the challenges of usage (which must be respected and compatible with this management) and safety. In the Sept Deniers neighborhood, there are parks but also more scattered green spaces. The installation of dedicated panels to raise awareness among users about the presence of tall grasses, biodiversity, and also respect for plants and public space in general meets the needs. Cost: Graphic design involving an illustrator, manufacturing, and installation of several panels in green spaces - â‚¬50,000.

Cost: 1000.0 â‚¬
District: 11 - Bonhoure / GuilhemÃ©ry / ChÃ¢teau de l'Hers / Limayrac / CÃ´te PavÃ©e
Description: Faced with the increasing number of mosquitoes in the neighborhood, I propose that the installation of mosquito traps on my street be experimented with. Traps such as ""ma boÃ®te Ã  moustiques"", Qista, etc., appear to be effective and are being trialed by communities. This experiment could involve willing residents of my street, and we could assess the effectiveness of these traps in conjunction with the services.

";"- **Local Relevance and Impact**: The project addresses a specific and relatable issue (mosquito nuisance) in the ChÃ¢teau de l'Hers neighborhood, which could attract votes from residents directly affected by the problem. However, its appeal might be limited to those living in close proximity to the area.

- **Cost-Effectiveness**: With a low cost of 1000 euros, the project is highly affordable relative to the total budget of 8,000,000 euros. This could make it more likely to be funded even if it doesn't receive a top ranking in votes, as it represents a minimal financial risk.

- **Visibility and Urgency**: Projects that address more visible or urgent city-wide issues tend to attract more votes. The mosquito trap project, while beneficial, might not be perceived as urgent compared to other proposals that impact a larger demographic or address more critical infrastructure needs.

- **Historical Voting Patterns**: Analyzing past participatory budgeting results could provide insights, but typically, smaller, localized projects receive fewer votes than larger, more impactful ones. However, they also face less competition in their specific categories or districts.

- **Project Support and Promotion**: The level of organization and promotion by the project proposers can significantly influence the number of votes. Active campaigning within the community and online could enhance visibility and support.

- **Comparative Analysis**: Considering the total number of voters (4,532 in 2022) and typical vote distribution, a small, localized project might attract a modest portion of the total votes, especially if there are competing projects with broader appeal.

Project: Securing pedestrians and cyclists at the corner of Henri Bessemer Road and Chemin du Sang de Serp
Cost: 100000.0 â‚¬
District: 8 - Minimes / BarriÃ¨re de Paris / Ponts-Jumeaux / La Vache / Raisins / Fondeyre
Description: At the intersection of Bessemer Road and Sang de Serp Road, there is no secure pedestrian crossing. Traffic is increasingly heavy on Sang de Serp Road and through the small adjacent streets (notably Bessemer Road) as drivers try to avoid the congested main roads. It has become very difficult and especially very dangerous to cross when one is a pedestrian or cyclist. Beyond proposing security measures, I am raising the alarm about the danger of this location for pedestrians and cyclists. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Possible security enhancement on a raised platform.

";"- **Relevance and Urgency**: The project addresses a significant safety concern for pedestrians and cyclists, which is a pressing issue in urban areas, especially in busy districts like the 8th in Toulouse. Safety projects tend to resonate well with urban voters who experience these issues daily.

- **District Characteristics**: The 8th district includes diverse neighborhoods with varying traffic and pedestrian dynamics. The specific area mentioned (Henri Bessemer Road and Chemin du Sang de Serp) is noted for its traffic issues, which likely affects a large number of residents and commuters.

- **Cost Efficiency**: With a project cost of 100,000 euros, this initiative is relatively affordable compared to other urban infrastructure projects. This cost-effectiveness could appeal to voters who are conscious of budget allocation efficiency.

- **Voter Engagement**: Historical data from previous participatory budgeting elections indicates that projects with a clear, direct benefit to community safety and mobility tend to attract higher voter interest. Given the project's focus and moderate cost, it is likely to be well-supported.

- **Competition and Comparison**: The project's success also depends on the nature of competing projects in the same election cycle. Assuming a typical range of projects, a safety-related project in a busy district could be expected to perform well.

- **Estimation of Votes**: Based on the factors above, the project could be estimated to receive a moderate to high number of votes. Considering the total number of voters and typical distribution, a reasonable estimate might be around the upper quartile of the voting distribution.

- **Ranking Prediction**: Given the project's relevance, cost, and potential voter base, it is likely to rank well, possibly within the top 20% of projects, especially if the total number of projects is large and varies in scope and impact.

Project: Secure the bike passage between Rue de Metz and Pont Neuf
Cost: 2000.0 â‚¬
District: 1 - Capitole / Arnaud Bernard / Carmes
Description: The new bike lane created on Rue de Metz finally allows for bike traffic on dedicated paths. One very dangerous point remains at the end of Rue de Metz, to cross Quai de Tounis towards Pont Neuf. Bikes coming from Rue de Metz cannot see cars turning left into Quai de Tounis from the same street. A separate bike traffic light, offset from the car lights, would be necessary for safe crossing for all users. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal as formulated cannot be accepted. Indeed, by regulation, the bike crossing is managed by the pedestrian light. As with all intersections with traffic lights, when the pedestrian light is green, vehicles in the left-turn lane also have a green light and must be vigilant for crossing bikes and pedestrians. Moreover, a three-color bike traffic light cannot be installed because this equipment requires a phase during which the bike light is on. This is not feasible due to the significant impact on traffic on Rue de Metz. However, an experiment can be set up on this pedestrian light with the installation of a bike crossing box: this will allow for a better understanding of the intersection by cyclists.

";"- **Urban Context and Project Relevance**: Toulouse, being a city with a significant number of cyclists and ongoing urban mobility projects, has a population that is generally supportive of improvements to cycling infrastructure. The project's focus on safety at a busy intersection could appeal to a broad audience, including cyclists and pedestrians.

- **Project Cost and Feasibility**: The project's low cost (2000.0 â‚¬) makes it an attractive option in the participatory budgeting process, as it allows for potentially many other projects to be funded alongside it. Its feasibility, despite regulatory challenges, is enhanced by the proposed experimental approach.

- **Voting Dynamics**: In previous participatory budgeting elections, projects with a focus on safety and low costs tend to receive a higher number of votes. Given that each voter can select up to three projects, cost-effective projects that address urgent needs are likely to be prioritized by voters.

- **District Influence**: The project is located in District 1, which includes central and historically significant areas like Capitole and Carmes. These areas are densely populated and have active community engagement, which could translate into higher voting participation for local projects.

- **Competition and Budget Constraints**: The total budget and the number of competing projects will influence the final ranking. However, given the project's low cost, it is less likely to be skipped over due to budget constraints in the selection process.

- **Estimated Votes and Position**: Based on the factors above, the project could be expected to receive a moderate to high number of votes, placing it in a favorable position in the ranking, especially considering its relevance, cost, and the district's active community.

- **District-Specific Interest**: The project is targeted at district 15, Croix de Pierre / Route d'Espagne. Projects that target specific districts can receive strong local support, but might not appeal as broadly across the entire city.

- **Comparison with Previous Projects**: Drawing parallels with similar successful initiatives in other districts (like the Compans-Amidonniers district) could boost voter confidence in the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Given that each voter can select up to three projects, voters might be inclined to include this low-cost, high-impact project among their choices, especially if they are residents of or familiar with the affected district.

- **Estimation of Votes**: Considering the factors above, the project could be moderately popular. However, without specific historical voting data for similar projects, a precise estimate is challenging. A reasonable assumption might be a mid-range popularity.

- **Ranking Prediction**: Given the low cost and potentially moderate to high appeal, the project could rank well among other projects, especially if many higher-cost projects exceed the remaining budget at any point in the selection process.

Project: Redevelopment of the park at rue Fonquerne / rue Jean Nico
Cost: 250000.0 â‚¬
District: 8 - Minimes / BarriÃ¨re de Paris / Ponts-Jumeaux / La Vache / Raisins / Fondeyre
Description: The association Bien Vivre Chez Les Castors proposes to develop the park, which no longer meets current needs. Currently, the park is:
- Undersized
- A hazardous intersection due to a misunderstanding of the traffic flow
- Too sunny and unusable in summer

Proposal:
- Removal of a road replaced by a green space and a bike path
- Expansion of the area
- Improvement of a shaded, intergenerational community space

ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The redevelopment of the playground at the corner of Rue Fonquerne and Jean Nico is not straightforward, consultation with the residents is necessary as several options will be proposed. Changes to traffic flow, turning circles, and the possible rerouting of networks could exceed the budget of â‚¬250,000.

";"- **Project Appeal and Relevance**: The project focuses on enhancing a public park, which generally has broad appeal due to its community and environmental benefits. The addition of trees and facilities for people with reduced mobility increases its attractiveness.

- **District Characteristics**: District 8 includes diverse neighborhoods, some of which are densely populated and could highly benefit from improved public spaces. This could drive higher local support for the project.

- **Budget and Cost Efficiency**: At 80,000 euros, the project is moderately priced, which makes it a feasible choice under the budget constraints of 8,000,000 euros. This cost allows for potentially funding multiple such projects without exhausting the budget quickly.

- **Voting Trends**: Based on previous participatory budgeting patterns, projects that enhance communal living spaces and environmental conditions tend to perform well. The project's focus on inclusivity (facilities for people with reduced mobility) and environmental improvement (planting trees) aligns with these trends.

- **Competition and Comparison**: The project's success also depends on the number and nature of competing proposals. Assuming a typical range of projects, a well-presented and community-focused project like this one should rank well.

- **Historical Data and Estimation**: Assuming a similar voter turnout as in 2022 (4,532 voters) and considering the project's appeal, a reasonable estimate of votes might be around the upper middle range of total votes, given the project's relevance and moderate budget.

- **Ranking and Algorithm**: Given the project's cost-effectiveness and broad appeal, it is likely to be ranked in the upper quartile, especially if it garners a significant number of votes relative to its cost. The greedy algorithm used for selection would favor this project due to its reasonable cost and potential high vote count.

Project: Soothe and greenify Rue de la Dalbade
Cost: 75000.0 â‚¬
District: 1 - Capitole / Arnaud Bernard / Carmes
Description: Hello, La rue de la Dalbade is very mineral-like, and the surroundings of the school are very dangerous because vehicles do not respect the speed limits on this street. By redesigning the front of the school with shrubs and a raised crossing, it would be possible to reduce vehicle speeds and calm this area. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Since January 2023, the Fabre nursery school has benefited from the 'school street' scheme on rue Saint-Jean. This scheme reduces traffic during school entry and exit times in front of the nursery school. An evaluation of the scheme is planned very soon with the parents of students and local residents. Depending on the feedback, additional modifications could be made. Regarding the security issues on rue de la Dalbade and around Fabre elementary school, a speed bump is already in place, and speed measurements are low. However, in addition to the existing speed bump, the deployment of a speed reduction scheme on the street can be proposed. The road markings could also be revised, particularly for pedestrian crossings near the school. A parking space will also be removed at the corner of Dalbade and St Jean for better visibility of the pedestrian crossing. Concerning the very mineral aspect of rue de la Dalbade, it can be proposed to ""green"" Pierre BruniÃ¨re street (type of project with stemmed shrubs) where the sidewalk is wider than that of rue de la Dalbade (subject to the approval of the Architecte des BÃ¢timents de France and the absence of networks). Indeed, rue de la Dalbade is long, and such an arrangement is not compatible with the deadlines and budget associated with this participatory budget.

";"- **District Coverage and Appeal**: The project covers a large district (16 - Fontaine-Lestang / ArÃ¨nes / Bagatelle / Papus / Tabar / Bordelongue / Mermoz / La Faourette), which suggests a potentially high voter base due to the number of residents affected.

- **Project Theme and Relevance**: The focus on improving green spaces and enhancing mobility (bike and foot paths) aligns well with contemporary urban priorities such as sustainability and quality of life, likely appealing to a broad demographic.

- **Cost vs. Budget**: The project cost (225,000 â‚¬) is relatively moderate compared to the total available budget (8,000,000 â‚¬), making it a feasible choice for funding without exhausting resources, thus potentially ranking higher.

- **Comparative Analysis**: Assuming similar voting patterns to previous years and considering the project's appeal and practicality, it might attract a significant portion of the votes. Projects with environmental and community benefits typically perform well in participatory budgeting contexts.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Each voter can select up to 3 projects, which might dilute the total votes per project but also allows for strategic voting where voters support projects that are not only desirable but also likely to be funded.

- **Historical Data and Trends**: Based on previous participatory budgeting outcomes in Toulouse, projects that enhance communal spaces and infrastructure tend to rank well. The project's focus on both aesthetic and functional improvements could boost its popularity.

- **Estimation and Ranking**: Given these factors, the project could receive a higher number of votes, placing it in a favorable position for funding. The exact rank might depend on the competition from other projects but is expected to be in the upper tier.

Project: Installation of wooden planters at the Claude Nougaro metro station
Cost: 35000.0 â‚¬
District: 8 - Minimes / BarriÃ¨re de Paris / Ponts-Jumeaux / La Vache / Raisins / Fondeyre
Description: A row of hackberry trees cools the Minimes Avenue. However, due to the metro access construction, this row has been interrupted over a significant length. As a result, it gets very hot there in the summer. My idea would be to restore the alignment and place a shade structure where it's not possible (the restaurant terraces would be more attractive). It would also be a good opportunity to regulate the trash bins, as this area is overrun with them all day Sunday. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Planting trees is impossible over a metro corridor. There is a possibility to be validated by TissÃ©o, using artificial planters without the possibility of connecting to the natural ground is feasible (about 15 m long).

Project: Redevelopment of the courtyard of the Borderouge nursery school
Cost: 60000.0 â‚¬
District: 9 - Trois Cocus / Borderouge / Croix-Daurade / PalÃ©ficat / Grand Selve
Description: The greening of schoolyards (""oasis courtyards"") has widely demonstrated its benefits for our children: adapting our infrastructure to climate warming and the now inevitable heatwaves, as well as familiarizing our children with nature. We therefore request the creation of an oasis courtyard at the Borderouge preschool, which is particularly concreted. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The Toulouse City Hall has launched a program to develop schoolyards to meet the challenges of cooling, but also inclusion and diversity in these spaces for play and learning. This program is planned with regard to multi-criteria priorities, taking into account factors such as shade, soil, etc. The courtyard of the Borderouge preschool has not been classified among the highest priority given its recent redevelopment. If this idea were accepted, this schoolyard could potentially benefit from new plantings and the installation of a play area in the existing soil spaces.

";"- **Project Appeal and Theme**: The ""Garden birdhouses"" project focuses on enhancing biodiversity, which is a popular theme among urban populations increasingly concerned about environmental issues. This could attract a significant number of votes from environmentally conscious residents.

- **Cost and Feasibility**: The project cost is relatively low (â‚¬10,000) compared to the total budget (â‚¬8,000,000), making it more likely to be funded even if it doesn't rank at the very top. Lower-cost projects often have a better chance of being selected as they allow more projects to be funded within the budget.

- **District Characteristics**: The project is proposed for District 12, which includes diverse neighborhoods. This could mean a varied voter base, potentially increasing the project's appeal across different community groups.

- **Voting Dynamics**: In participatory budgeting, projects that address visible and widely appreciated improvements tend to receive more votes. Birdhouses in public parks can be seen as enhancing the local environment, which is a tangible benefit to voters.

- **Comparison with Past Projects**: Analyzing past participatory budgeting results could provide insights into how similar projects fared. Projects with environmental impact and low costs tend to perform well.

- **Voter Engagement**: Assuming a similar turnout to the 2022 election (4,532 voters), and considering the project's broad appeal, a reasonable estimate of votes could be made by comparing it to similar past projects.

- **Ranking and Budget Allocation**: Given its low cost and potentially broad appeal, the project might rank well but not necessarily at the top, as projects with more direct human benefits (like playgrounds or community centers) might attract more votes.

";"- **District and Demand**: The project is located in District 10, which includes neighborhoods like Jolimont and Roseraie. These areas are residential and likely have a significant number of cyclists who would benefit from improved infrastructure, suggesting a potentially high interest in the project.

- **Project Cost and Feasibility**: With a cost of 50,000 euros, the project is relatively affordable compared to other urban projects. This lower cost might make it more likely to be funded within the available budget of 8 million euros.

- **Safety and Utility**: The project addresses a critical safety issue by proposing a bike path in an area with a high incidence of accidents involving cyclists. Projects that enhance safety and connect poorly served areas tend to attract more votes due to their direct impact on residents' well-being.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Based on previous participatory budgeting patterns, projects that cater to a wide audience or solve pressing issues tend to receive more votes. The creation of a bike path fits this criterion.

- **Competition and Comparison**: The number of votes a project receives also depends on the other projects proposed in the same election. Without details on competing projects, an exact estimate is challenging, but given the project's merits, it is likely to perform well.

- **Historical Data and Trends**: Analyzing past participatory budgeting results in Toulouse, projects with a focus on transportation and safety usually rank higher in both votes and priority for funding.

- **Estimation and Ranking**: Considering these factors, the project could be estimated to receive a moderate to high number of votes. Given its utility, cost, and potential voter base, it might rank in the upper quartile in the final list of funded projects.

Project: Greening and de-asphalting of Compans Street
Cost: 235000.0 â‚¬
District: 4 - Lapujade / Bonnefoy / PÃ©riole / Marengo / La Colonne
Description: Depaving and greening of Compans Street as in the 3 Pillars Street at Arnaud Bernard. The objectives are both ecological and aesthetic:
- Combat the intensifying heatwaves
- Reduce flooding by better absorbing excess water
- Increase biodiversity
- Add more greenery and color to the avenue
ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The section between Marengo Boulevard and Colonne Avenue has been recently redeveloped. Moreover, a gas pipeline is buried under the sidewalk on the residential side, meaning that the project would be over budget considering the costs of diverting networks. Additionally, no planting can be carried out on the railway side. The section between Colonne Avenue and CimetiÃ¨re Avenue, however, can be greened in line with the odd-numbered parking spaces, as the gas network runs on the other side of the street. Such a project would eliminate about 14 parking spaces.

Project: Installation of plant structures on Rue de l'Orient
Cost: 50000.0 â‚¬
District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
Description: Every day, families walk along the streets of l'Orient and Saint-Orens to take their children to school. These streets need to be calmed and closed to traffic. Access to private parking must be preserved. Replace parking spaces with planters, children's play areas, street furniture, and dog parks. Install manual barriers for security. Create opportunities to use the space for flea markets, festivals, meals, and entertainment. Create a pedestrian and bicycle path. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Pedestrianizing the axis from rue de l'Orient to Saint Orens cannot be considered under this scheme. Indeed, this axis is very long and such a proposal would require a comprehensive review of the traffic plan and a study of an arrangement that integrates the updating of public spaces in terms of accessibility, soft mobility, etc. Such a project is not compatible with the deadlines and costs associated with this participatory budget. However, a consultation must be initiated before the end of the year as part of the redevelopment project of Place Jeanne d'Arc: this axis should be included in the study perimeter. Nevertheless, a specific arrangement on the only section of the widened sidewalk (opposite the impasse de l'Orient) with the possible removal of 2 parking spaces (corner of rue Raymond IV) could be carried out with the installation of ""vegetal structures"" that would enhance and cool the street. This project will be feasible subject to compatibility with existing networks and prior approval from the ABF.

This could attract a significant number of votes from residents who prioritize environmental and safety improvements.

- **Cost vs. Budget**: The project cost of 50,000 euros is relatively low compared to the total available budget of 8,000,000 euros. This makes it more likely to be funded without exhausting the budget, appealing to pragmatic voters who prefer feasible projects.

- **District Characteristics**: District 3 includes diverse neighborhoods with active community involvement. Projects in such areas tend to receive good support if they align well with local needs and sentiments.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Given that each voter can select up to three projects, projects with broad appeal and immediate benefits, like this one, are likely to be chosen frequently.

- **Competition and Comparison**: The project's success also depends on the number and nature of competing proposals. However, its moderate cost and high relevance could give it an edge over more expensive or less impactful projects.

- **Historical Voting Patterns**: Analyzing past participatory budgeting results could provide insights, but generally, projects enhancing daily life quality in dense urban areas tend to perform well.

- **Limitations and Constraints**: The project description notes some limitations regarding the full pedestrianization of the area, which might slightly reduce its appeal to those seeking more radical changes. However, the proposed enhancements are still substantial.

Project: Refurbishment of the existing ramp for access to the Garonne dike (av. de Muret) from the parking area below the Fer Ã  Cheval.
Cost: 150000.0 â‚¬
District: 6 - Saint-Cyprien
Description: Access to the dike via the dead-end at the washhouse can only be achieved by a staircase, which is inconvenient for pedestrians and unsuitable for bicycles. Transforming this dead-end into a passage for bicycles and pedestrians would allow easy access to the dike from Avenue de Muret. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: An improvement of the access from the parking area below the Fer Ã  Cheval to the top of the dike is proposed (ground refurbishment, signposting, replacement of concrete walls...), subject to technical feasibility. Regulatory and technical reasons do not allow for the construction of a ramp on the dead-end of the Lavoir. Indeed, any development project must be accessible to people with reduced mobility. Therefore, if a ramp for pedestrians and bicycles were to be constructed at the end of the dead-end, it would have to comply with regulatory standards of a 4% slope with a resting platform every 10 meters. Here, there is about 2 meters between the level of the dead-end and the level of the dike. This would require a development of at least 50 linear meters, which is not feasible given the depth (about 6 meters) of the space at the end of the dead-end.

";"- **Project Relevance and Appeal**: The project addresses a practical issue of accessibility to the Garonne dike, which is a significant area for residents of Saint-Cyprien and visitors. Improving access for pedestrians and bicycles enhances usability and inclusivity, which are appealing factors for a broad audience.

- **Cost Consideration**: At 150,000 euros, the project is moderately priced within the typical range for participatory budgeting projects. This cost is feasible within the total budget of 8,000,000 euros, making it likely to be funded if it receives enough votes.

- **District Impact**: The project is located in District 6 - Saint-Cyprien, a well-populated and active area of Toulouse. Projects that directly benefit local residents tend to receive good support in participatory budgeting.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Based on previous participatory budgeting outcomes, projects that enhance community infrastructure or accessibility tend to perform well.

District: 8 - Minimes / BarriÃ¨re de Paris / Ponts-Jumeaux / La Vache / Raisins / Fondeyre
Description: The high speed of vehicles along the Canal du Midi axis makes the use of pedestrian crossings without lights impossible. This is particularly the case for the one located under the Haedens footbridge: we therefore propose to install a push-button activated traffic light at this location. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: There is a study available that allows for the upgrading of the bus stop, the installation of a traffic light, and the securing of the pedestrian crossing, with the estimated cost of the works exceeding the budget of â‚¬250,000 per idea within the framework of the Participatory Budget regulation. Moreover, the Grand Parc Canal project may impact this route. It seems more prudent to wait to have a clear view of the planned developments. In compensation, the Sang de Serp intersection is equipped with ducting, allowing for the activation of a traffic light and the necessary additional arrangement for the cycle path at this location.

Project: Greening and de-asphalting of Cemetery Avenue
Cost: 250000.0 â‚¬
District: 4 - Lapujade / Bonnefoy / PÃ©riole / Marengo / La Colonne
Description: Depaving under certain trees on Cemetery Avenue (those without parking spaces, bike racks, or electric charging stations). As in front of 24 Cemetery Avenue and Rue des 3 Piliers at Arnaud Bernard. The goals are both ecological and aesthetic:
Reduce flooding by allowing better absorption of excess water, which will benefit the trees
Improve soil quality for the trees
Increase biodiversity
Add more greenery and color to the avenue
ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Cemetery Avenue could be depaved in two types of areas (75 diagonal parking spaces and spaces between tree bases). Initially, the project could extend from Saint Paul Street to the cemetery parking lot. Then, in a second phase (outside the participatory budget), on the parking lot directly in front of the cemetery entrance. The project would involve removing the existing pavement between the tree bases and replacing it with grassed concrete slabs that allow for vehicle parking. This would reduce the amount of paved surface while still maintaining on-street parking availability. Such a project would need to be reviewed by SDIS 31 to ensure compatibility with fire service access to buildings. Finally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green these streets. Facades, for example, can be greened at the owner's request, with support from the community. The owner must also commit to maintaining the planters in the long term. This initiative will be subject to technical feasibility conditions: no underground networks, no basements or crawl spaces, and pedestrian continuity must be maintained. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the city and metropolitan technical services once residents submit their requests via the online form available on the community's website.

Cost: 40000.0 â‚¬
District: 11 - Bonhoure / GuilhemÃ©ry / ChÃ¢teau de l'Hers / Limayrac / CÃ´te PavÃ©e
Description: At the corner of Rue MoniÃ© and Avenue Jean Chaubet, a small bitumen triangle of a few square meters has been used as an illegal dump for over 30 years. Why has the city council never addressed this known public hygiene issue? To deter polluters, it would be necessary to decontaminate the soil to allow grass and some plants to grow, and also to install anti-car bollards to prevent vehicles from accessing the site, from which washing machines, sofas, and other trash bags are unloaded at night. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It seems indeed that there are few voluntary drop-off points (PAV) in the neighborhood because few locations are suitable for the dimensions of the PAVs: the idea is acceptable. Depending on the site and soil constraints, count â‚¬4000 per planting pit and tree. These plantings could be complemented by ground-cover plants at the base of trees and shrubs.

Your task is to analyze the following project, proposed as part of a new participatory budgeting election in year 2024.

Project: Mark the pedestrian crossings and slow down traffic on Gabriel PÃ©ri and d'Aubuisson streets.
Cost: 40000.0 â‚¬
District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
Description: ðŸ’¡ THE IDEA EXPRESSED BY @MikaTlse: First on Gabriel PÃ©ri street, then Riquet, Aubuisson, and wherever the speed is too high. The targeted vehicles are cars but also two-wheelers! It would be necessary to install speed bumps with a gentler slope across the entire length of the crossing (to prevent two-wheelers from swerving to avoid them). Do this primarily for major roads: to slow down traffic, for pedestrian safety, and for vehicles that are victims of right-of-way violations. Adjust the number based on cost. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Arrangements can be proposed on Gabriel PÃ©ri and Aubuisson streets, as Riquet street has just been completely redesigned with the integration of devices that encourage speed reduction. Speed bumps/Berlin cushions could be installed on these two streets near pedestrian crossings and intersections, to reduce vehicle speed. However, prior road counts must be carried out to confirm this issue.

Project: Remove the asphalt from the TUC Rugby parking lot
Cost: 187200.0 â‚¬
District: 11 - Bonhoure / GuilhemÃ©ry / ChÃ¢teau de l'Hers / Limayrac / CÃ´te PavÃ©e
Description: The parking area of the TUC Rugby facilities on Rue C Rougenet is fully paved. In the era of climate change and the fight against heat islands, I propose that the parking be depaved to eliminate an impermeable surface (about 3000 mÂ²) and ""break up"" a heat island. To accommodate the parking usage, it could be fitted with solutions like evergreen slabs. If the cost exceeds â‚¬250k, 2 phases could be considered. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Since the parking belongs to the city of Toulouse, it is possible to depave it.

Project: Greening of Lejeune and Lancefoc Streets
Cost: 145000.0 â‚¬
District: 2 - Amidonniers / Compans-Caffarelli / Brouardel
Description: Hello, Like Embarthe Street, with our neighborhood association BALLH, we would like Lejeunes and Lancefoc streets to be greened in order to bring some coolness during the heatwave, greenery to be less concrete, to attract more biodiversity, to remove this excess of asphalt, to give a countryside look, etc... ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Generally, many networks are present in Lejeune and Lancefoc streets. Also, a greening project on these streets would require the prior diversion of networks, an operation incompatible with the deadlines and costs associated with this participatory budget. However, a redevelopment of the Lejeune / Lancefoc intersection aimed at reducing the lanes dedicated to traffic, by widening pedestrian public spaces, with a view to making plantings, is feasible. Finally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green this street. This initiative, after agreement from the concerned owners, is subject to technical feasibility conditions: no underground networks, no cellars or crawl spaces, pedestrian continuity to be respected. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the technical services of the city hall and the metropolis, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

";"- **Project Appeal and Theme**: The project focuses on urban greening, which is generally popular due to increasing environmental awareness. This theme aligns with contemporary concerns about climate change and urban heat islands, likely attracting a significant number of votes.

- **District Characteristics**: The project is proposed for District 2 - Amidonniers / Compans-Caffarelli / Brouardel, a central and active area of Toulouse. The population density and active community involvement in such districts can lead to higher engagement and voting.

- **Project Cost**: At 145,000 euros, the project is moderately priced compared to the total budget of 8 million euros. This cost allows for the possibility of funding multiple projects, making it a feasible choice under the budget constraints.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Based on previous participatory budgeting elections, projects that are not overly expensive and have a broad appeal (like greening and environmental projects) tend to perform well.

- **Technical Feasibility and Modifications**: The original proposal for greening might face challenges due to technical constraints (e.g., underground networks), but the modified proposal focusing on the intersection and ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative is more feasible. This adjustment might affect its attractiveness slightly if voters preferred the original broader scope.

- **Competition and Comparison**: The project's success also depends on the number and nature of competing projects. Without specific details on other projects, it's assumed that this project has a competitive edge due to its reasonable cost and popular theme.

- **Historical Data and Estimation**: Assuming a similar voter turnout as in 2022 (4,532 voters) and considering the project's appeal and feasibility, a reasonable estimate of votes could be around the upper quartile of participation based on past trends.

Project: Tree Densification in the Bois de Ribaute
Cost: 250000.0 â‚¬
District: 12 - Pont des Demoiselles / Ormeau / Montaudran / La Terrasse / MalepÃ¨re
Description: The educational forest of Ribaute covers an area of 32 hectares, and 537 trees and shrubs have been planted there. From a forestry perspective, as a green lung and the creation of green spaces for the future 20,000 inhabitants of the MalepÃ¨re Marcaissone district, this is a start but clearly insufficient. With an average density of 800 trees per hectare, at least 25,000 more trees are needed. At an average cost of â‚¬4,000 per hectare, this would amount to â‚¬128,000. We would see the results in 20-30 years. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Given the budget, it is possible to plant an additional 300 trees in the Ribaute forest. The site will be secured beforehand.

District: 15 - Croix de Pierre / Route d'Espagne
Description: On the road to Spain, between the September 21 roundabout and the peripheral bridge, it would be advisable to remove the central median where there is no car crossing. Instead, given the width, a multitude of plants could be planted to cool down this street. This could be done in partnership with the children from the Oustalous school to raise their awareness of ecology. It would help to de-impermeabilize a good portion of the street and also prevent illegal parking. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Removal of asphalt and planting of vegetation on the central medians of the road to Spain in order to reduce the heat of this axis in summer.

";"- **Relevance and Appeal**: The project focuses on environmental improvement and urban beautification, which are generally popular themes in urban participatory budgeting. Its involvement with local schools to promote ecological awareness adds a community engagement aspect that could attract additional support.

- **Cost Considerations**: At 250,000 euros, the project is moderately priced, which means it could potentially be funded without exhausting a significant portion of the budget. This cost is neither too low to be considered trivial nor too high to be deemed unaffordable, striking a good balance in terms of cost-effectiveness.

- **District Characteristics**: District 15 - Croix de Pierre / Route d'Espagne is an area that could benefit from greening projects due to its urban setting. Projects that aim to improve the quality of life in denser districts tend to be well-received.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Based on previous participatory budgeting outcomes, projects that combine environmental impact with community involvement tend to perform well. The ability of voters to choose up to three projects may favor moderately popular projects like this one.

- **Competition and Budget Constraints**: The final position in the ranking will also depend on the nature and appeal of competing projects, as well as the total budget available. The project's moderate cost allows it to be a feasible choice even if several higher-cost projects are also popular.

- **Historical Data and Trends**: Analyzing past participatory budgeting results in Toulouse, projects with environmental and community engagement themes usually receive a good amount of support, often placing in the upper-middle tier of the rankings.

Project: Installation of bike racks in the Chalets district
Cost: 3240.0 â‚¬
District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
Description: In the Chalets district, as well as throughout Toulouse, more and more bicycles are being parked on the streets in a very anarchic manner. The increasing use of bicycles only amplifies this phenomenon. Proposal: install bicycle parking in the streets in place of one or more car parking spaces. These exist but are very few. Consider other means of parking bicycles. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: To avoid the anarchic parking of bicycles in the Chalets district, the community proposes the installation of urban furniture such as bicycle racks. These installations can be carried out on car parking spaces of a single spot: this parking must be protected or ""integrated"" for safety and protection of cyclists. In this district, most streets have unprotected parking and narrow sidewalks that do not allow the addition of bicycle supports. However, Rue de la Balance (at the right of No. 40 on a 2-car parking space) and Rue des Chalets (about 7 vehicle spaces protected by curbs) could accommodate bicycle racks. If this idea were adopted, 9 vehicle parking spaces would be removed on these 2 streets.

";"**Reasoning:**

1. **Project Appeal and Relevance**: The project involves installing an artwork in a square that is central to the district and has historical significance. This could attract votes from residents interested in cultural development and the beautification of public spaces.

2. **District Characteristics**: District 15 - Croix de Pierre / Route d'Espagne is undergoing renovation, indicating a focus on urban development. Residents in such areas might be more inclined to support projects that promise to enhance their neighborhood's aesthetics and cultural significance.

3. **Project Cost**: At 100,000 euros, the project is relatively affordable compared to other large-scale urban projects. This lower cost might allow it to be more easily funded within the budget constraints, making it appealing to voters who want to see feasible projects succeed.

4. **Voting Dynamics**: Given that each voter can select up to three projects, projects that resonate on a cultural or community level might receive higher votes due to their broad appeal.

5. **Historical Voting Trends**: Without specific past voting data for similar projects, a conservative estimate would consider a mid-range popularity. Projects with a cultural or community focus typically perform moderately well in participatory budgeting settings.

6. **Competition**: The number of competing projects and their nature (infrastructure, environmental, social services) could significantly influence the ranking. Assuming a moderate level of competition, a well-presented cultural project in a developing district could rank well.

7. **Budget Allocation Strategy**: The greedy algorithm used for funding prioritizes projects by votes until the budget cap is reached. A moderately expensive project with decent support could be funded early if not many high-cost projects dominate the top of the list.

Project: Installation of exercise equipment for muscle strengthening at Parc des Sept Deniers
Cost: 10000.0 â‚¬
District: 7 - Sept Deniers / Ginestous-SesquiÃ¨res / Lalande
Description: This park is rather underappreciated, even being transformed into a parking lot when there are matches at Stade Toulousain. It would be interesting to enhance its value to improve the living environment of the neighborhood in anticipation of its upcoming densification with the arrival of line C. For example, it would be interesting to take advantage of the available space to plant new trees and/or install a street workout type sports facility. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A section of the park will be developed to install a playground with a zip line as well as a city stadium. In order to avoid overloading with equipment and to maintain a natural space aspect, it is proposed to additionally install 4 muscle strengthening apparatuses: dip bars, pull-up bar, wall bars, and a ladder.

";"- **Local Relevance and Appeal**: The project targets the enhancement of Parc des Sept Deniers, a location that gains attention during events at Stade Toulousain but is otherwise underutilized. The proposal to install exercise equipment could attract residents interested in outdoor activities and fitness, aligning with a growing public interest in health and wellness.

- **Cost Efficiency**: With a relatively low cost of 10,000 euros, this project is economically feasible within the total budget of 8 million euros. Its affordability could make it a more attractive option for voters who prefer to see multiple smaller projects funded.

- **District Characteristics**: The 7th district, including Sept Deniers, Ginestous-SesquiÃ¨res, and Lalande, might have varying priorities, but enhancing a local park could be seen as beneficial for community development and quality of life, appealing to a broad segment of the district's residents.

- **Competition and Project Scope**: The project's success in the voting process will depend on the number and nature of competing proposals. Projects with broader appeal or in more densely populated districts might draw votes away from this one.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Based on previous participatory budgeting patterns, projects that enhance communal spaces or provide tangible benefits to daily life tend to perform well. However, the exact number of votes will depend on the overall number of projects and their distribution across different themes and districts.

- **Historical Data and Estimation**: Without specific historical voting data for similar projects in Toulouse, estimating votes can be challenging. However, considering general trends in participatory budgeting, a project like this could be moderately popular.

Project: Access control at the entrance of Rue Cujas
Cost: 100000.0 â‚¬
District: 1 - Capitole / Arnaud Bernard / Carmes
Description: With travel already heavily restricted in the city center, the streets around the Place de la Bourse deserve to be pedestrianized. I am referring to the streets of Sainte Ursule, Bourse, ClÃ©mence Isaure, Cujas, and PrieurÃ©. These streets, not renovated for too long, only serve as diversion routes, or to access other streets that are already closed. My proposal: control at the entrances of all these streets with bollards. The benefits: less noise, less pollution, less risk of accidents... ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The installation of barriers at the entrance of each of these streets cannot be considered within the framework of this call for ideas (due to budget and associated implementation timelines). Indeed, the implementation of automated access controls on all these roads requires the initiation of in-depth studies that cannot be carried out over the dedicated period. Moreover, the streets of Saint Ursule, ClÃ©mence Isaure, Cujas, and PrieurÃ© deserve a comprehensive reflection in terms of planning, following the one carried out on Rue Gambetta. However, the installation of access control at the entrance of Rue Cujas can be considered within the framework of this call for ideas and initially, the buildings on this street do not have vehicle access. Such a project must nevertheless be submitted for the opinion of the Architecte des BÃ¢timents de France and subject to technical feasibility related to the presence of necessary networks. Additionally, it should be noted that a school street project is being studied for Rue du PrieurÃ© (Lakanal kindergarten).

Project: Tree-lined Debat Ponsan Avenue
Cost: 204000.0 â‚¬
District: 2 - Amidonniers / Compans-Caffarelli / Brouardel
Description: I propose planting a double row of tall-stem trees on both sides of Debat Ponsan Avenue. This excessively wide and impermeable artery is not green at all. This environmental and urban measure aims to ensure greater comfort of use for pedestrians. Desired spacing between each tree: 8 to 10 meters, respecting private access. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A row of trees (17 ground plantings) can be planted on the odd-numbered side of Debat Ponsan Street. The even-numbered side is affected by a gas network running from north to south of the road, requiring a network diversion beforehand, an operation incompatible with the deadlines/budget associated with this participatory budget. Note, this planting project would eliminate about 17 parking spaces. On the occasion of this redevelopment, the implementation of a bicycle lane on the even-numbered side can also be studied. Finally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green this street. This initiative, after agreement from the concerned owners, is subject to technical feasibility conditions: no underground networks, no cellars or crawl spaces, and pedestrian continuity to be respected. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the technical services of the city hall and the metropolis, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

The addition of green spaces and potential for a new bicycle lane align with broader environmental concerns and urban mobility improvements, likely appealing to a wide audience.

- **Cost vs. Budget**: The project cost of 204,000 euros is relatively moderate when compared to the total available budget of 8 million euros. This makes it more likely to be funded without exhausting the budget, allowing it to potentially rank higher among selected projects.

- **Impact on Infrastructure**: The project involves the removal of parking spaces, which might be a point of contention for some residents, particularly those who rely on car transportation. However, the environmental and pedestrian benefits might outweigh these concerns for the broader public.

- **Competition with Other Projects**: The number of votes and the project's rank will also depend on the nature and appeal of competing projects. Without specific details on other projects, it's challenging to precisely predict, but the project's moderate cost and significant visual and environmental impact could make it more competitive.

- **Historical Voting Patterns**: Based on previous participatory budgeting outcomes, projects that enhance communal spaces and environmental quality tend to perform well. The project's alignment with these themes suggests it could receive a substantial number of votes.

- **Technical and Logistical Feasibility**: The project is technically feasible but requires consideration of existing infrastructure like the gas network. This complexity might affect some voters' decisions but is unlikely to be a major deterrent given the project's benefits.

District: 12 - Pont des Demoiselles / Ormeau / Montaudran / La Terrasse / MalepÃ¨re
Description: A strength of the MalepÃ¨re / Carmes district is the significant presence of wooded areas, yet they are little known to residents. The creation of a permanent fun trail with panels on biodiversity/nature would help to unveil these spaces. The trail would connect the Bois de l'Hers, the Marcaissonne, the wooded areas along Chemin des Carmes and Malepere, the future urban farm, and the upcoming apiaries. Cost: difficult to estimate with our knowledge. 50,000 euros? ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: In this district, there are numerous wooded and green spaces that are of interest for biodiversity. Installing dedicated panels to raise awareness among users about the preservation of biodiversity, as well as respect for vegetation and public spaces in general, meets the needs. It would involve designing (drawings, graphic palettes, etc.) various panels that would discuss biodiversity and the practices to adopt to preserve the environment. Cost: Graphic design involving an illustrator, manufacturing, and installation of several panels in the green spaces.

";"**Reasoning:**

1. **Project Theme and Appeal**: The project focuses on environmental restoration and urban beautification, which are generally popular themes in urban settings. This could attract a significant number of votes from residents who prioritize green spaces and environmental issues.

2. **Cost Efficiency**: With a relatively low cost of 30,000 euros, the project is affordable compared to other potentially larger-scale projects. This cost efficiency might make it more likely to be funded within the available budget, appealing to pragmatic voters.

3. **District Impact**: The project is located in District 9, which includes diverse neighborhoods. The impact on a communal space could encourage higher local voter turnout from these areas.

4. **Voting Dynamics**: Given that each voter can select up to three projects, projects with broad appeal or immediate local impact tend to perform well. The environmental angle coupled with a small-scale, clear objective (replanting trees) may make this project a common choice among voters' selections.

5. **Historical Voting Patterns and Project Competition**: Without specific data on past participatory budgeting outcomes in Toulouse, it's challenging to predict exact numbers. However, assuming a moderate interest based on theme and cost, and considering competition from potentially more impactful or larger projects, this project might not be the top vote-getter but could rank well.

6. **Estimation and Confidence Interval**: Estimating votes requires considering both the appeal of the project and the number of competing projects. A reasonable assumption might be a mid-tier performance in voting, considering the factors above.

7. **Expected Position in Final Ranking**: Given the project's moderate appeal and low cost, it is likely to be funded early unless surpassed by projects with either significantly higher voter impact or lower costs. It might not be the top few but could be comfortably funded within the budget constraints.

Project: More bike racks at the Saint-Cyprien library
Cost: 800.0 â‚¬
District: 6 - Saint-Cyprien
Description: There is a bike rack in front of the Saint-Cyprien library, but it is very insufficient and there is not enough space for bikes to park. Often, people are forced to lock their bikes to the children's playground fence or the building's emergency staircase. Therefore, an additional bike rack is needed. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Urban furniture such as bike racks cannot be installed directly in front of the Saint-Cyprien library in continuation of the existing one along the facade or in front of the playground for the following reasons: the dedicated areas are too insufficient as they are needed for containers, for the movement of emergency vehicles, and also for pedestrians. The Charles de Fitte alleys offer bike stands about 30 meters from the library entrance. However, additional installations can be added at the corner of RÃ©clusane Street and Charles de Fitte alleys (about 70 meters from the library entrance), subject to the presence of underground networks.

";"- **Local Relevance and Demand**: The project addresses a specific and practical need in the Saint-Cyprien district, suggesting a localized but potentially strong interest among residents who frequent the library and face parking issues for their bikes.

- **Cost-Effectiveness**: With a relatively low cost of 800 euros, this project is highly affordable compared to many other urban projects. This could make it more likely to be funded within the available budget, appealing to voters who prioritize efficient use of funds.

- **Voter Behavior**: In participatory budgeting, projects that solve everyday inconveniences tend to receive a good amount of support, especially from those directly affected. The visibility of the problem (insufficient bike parking) can drive higher voter engagement from local residents.

- **Project Visibility and Accessibility**: The proposed location for the bike racks is close enough to the library to serve its users, yet strategically placed to avoid conflicts with other urban needs, which might appeal to a broader base of voters concerned with practical solutions and safety.

- **Comparative Advantage**: Given the low cost, the project might not only attract votes but also stand a better chance of being funded as it uses a smaller portion of the total budget, allowing more projects to be funded overall.

- **Historical Voting Patterns**: Assuming a similar turnout and voting pattern as in previous years, and considering the practical nature of the project, it could attract a moderate proportion of the total votes, especially from those within the district or frequent library users.

Description: Greening of the planters along the cemetery on Avenue de la Colonne with heat-tolerant, low-maintenance perennial plants. The goals are both ecological and aesthetic:
- Increase biodiversity
- Add more greenery and color to the avenue
- Contribute to the fight against climate change
ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal would be to remove the planters and create pits to plant climbers (similar to the ""flowers on my wall"" initiative). Indeed, planting in pits will ensure better longevity for the plants. However, this proposal will be feasible only after a diagnostic of the cemetery wall's structure confirms the possibility of removing the planters and creating the pits. Moreover, the continuity of the plantings cannot be maintained along the entire length of this wall in order to monitor the wall's condition. On the un-planted sections, a mural with a vegetation theme could be interspersed between two plantings, allowing for visual continuity.

";"- **Urban and Environmental Context**: Toulouse, being a major urban area, has ongoing concerns about air quality and urban heat islands. Projects that propose greening and environmental improvements tend to be popular as they address these concerns directly.

- **Project Appeal and Visibility**: The project involves greening a high-traffic area, which is highly visible to many residents and commuters. This visibility can increase the project's appeal, potentially attracting more votes.

- **Cost vs. Budget**: The project cost of â‚¬60,000 is relatively low in comparison to the total available budget of â‚¬8,000,000. Lower-cost projects might be more easily funded, allowing for more projects to be realized within the budget constraints.

- **District Involvement**: The project is located in a district that includes multiple neighborhoods, potentially affecting a larger number of residents who might support the project to see direct improvements in their local environment.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Based on previous participatory budgeting patterns, projects that are environmentally focused and benefit a wide range of residents tend to perform well. The ability to vote for up to three projects may encourage voters to support this project alongside others.

- **Comparative Analysis**: Assuming a similar number of participants (around 4,532 voters from the previous year) and considering the project's broad appeal and moderate cost, it is likely to receive a significant number of votes but might not be the top voted due to competition with other appealing projects.

- **Ranking Estimation**: Given the factors above, the project is likely to rank well but not necessarily at the very top, especially if there are other projects with either a higher immediate impact or those addressing more urgent needs.

Project: Drinking fountain at Place Sainte-Scarbes
Cost: 10000.0 â‚¬
District: 1 - Capitole / Arnaud Bernard / Carmes
Description: At least one tree, one bench, and one drinking fountain on each square. Whether in open soil or in pots, depending on the constraints of Historical Monuments, underground networks, and traffic, envisioning a tree from square to small square: TrinitÃ©, Rouaix, Perchepinte, Montoulieu, Stes-Scarbes, Boulbonne, St-Julien, and others with forgotten names: St-BarthÃ©lemy (Languedoc/Nazareth), Visitation (RÃ©musat/PÃ©rigord), 3 pillars (3 pillars/St-Charles/Gatien-Arnoult), Pouzonville (St-Charles/Pouzonville/Merly), with fixed bench and drinking fountain, roughly every 100 meters. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal to install a tree, a bench, and a fountain on each square cannot be accepted within the framework of this call for ideas. Some of the locations mentioned in the proposal have already undergone urban developments (some are completed, others are under study). Such projects are part of a broader requalification project (exceeding the amount allocated to the participatory budget), in order not to burden future projects. - Places de la TrinitÃ©, Rouaix, Boulbonne: these squares are already qualitatively developed. Drinking fountains are present in the nearby vicinity (between 70m to 250m). The limited free space, pedestrian continuities, emergency access, and existing underground networks do not allow for the installation of a tree and additional urban furniture. - Places Montoulieu, Perchepinte, St-Julien, St-BarthÃ©lemy (Languedoc/Nazareth): on these sites, so as not to burden a global project, the installation of a tree, a fountain, and a bench will need to be integrated into a global project (example Place Mage) or soon at Place du Parlement. - Rue des 3 pillars (3 pillars/St-Charles/Gatien-Arnoult): 2 trees will be planted as part of the Toulouse center project in the Arnaud Bernard district, along with chair-type furniture. - Rue Pouzonville (St-Charles/Pouzonville/Merly)/ rue de la Visitation (RÃ©musat/PÃ©rigord): the installation of a tree, a fountain, and a bench is compromised due to networks, terrace footprints, camera poles, pedestrian continuities. The limited free space does not allow for a favorable response to this request. Nevertheless, at Place Saintes-Scarbes, a drinking fountain can be installed subject to the presence of networks and the favorable opinion of the Architecte des BÃ¢timents de France. The installation of trees seems difficult, however, due to the proximity of the metro tunnel nearby.

";"- **Project Appeal and Scope**: The project proposes the installation of a drinking fountain at Place Sainte-Scarbes, which is a relatively small-scale and low-cost initiative compared to broader urban development projects. This could appeal to voters who prioritize practical and immediate improvements in their local environment.

- **Cost and Budget Constraints**: With a cost of only 10,000 euros, this project is significantly less expensive than many other urban projects. This low cost might make it more likely to be funded within the available budget of 8 million euros, as it allows for many such small projects to be funded.

- **Location and District Impact**: The project is located in District 1, which includes central and historically significant areas of Toulouse. Projects in such central districts might attract more attention and votes due to the higher population density and the visibility of the projects.

- **Voter Behavior and Preferences**: In participatory budgeting, projects that are straightforward, offer clear benefits, and require minimal disruption tend to be popular. The installation of a drinking fountain fits this criterion.

- **Competition and Relative Merit**: The project's success also depends on the nature and appeal of competing projects. Without specific details on other projects, it's challenging to precisely predict, but given the modest scope and cost, it's reasonable to assume it would be competitive.

- **Historical Voting Patterns**: Assuming a similar turnout to previous years and typical distribution of votes across projects, a small but useful project like this could attract a moderate number of votes, especially if there are no controversial aspects or significant opposition.

- **Ranking and Funding Probability**: Given its low cost, even with a moderate number of votes, the project could be high in the ranking of funded projects, as it allows the budget to stretch further and fund more projects.

Project: Educational sound radar on AllÃ©e de Brienne
Cost: 31500.0 â‚¬
District: 2 - Amidonniers / Compans-Caffarelli / Brouardel
Description: The noise from vehicles rolling on the pavement depends on: 1 - The pavement itself (type and condition of the surface). 2 - The speed of the vehicles. 3 - The eccentricities of some users, motorcycles/cars that wake up the residents of the entire neighborhood in the middle of the night. The urgent actions to be taken are: The repair of the pavement on the AllÃ©e with a noise-reducing surface. The installation of acoustic sensors associated with surveillance cameras planned for 2024. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Within the framework of this participatory budget and the associated deadlines and budget, it is not feasible to proceed with the replacement of the pavement surface. However, it is possible to install an educational radar which, with the help of a luminous panel, indicates to the driver whether the noise level of their motor vehicle is compliant or not.

Project: Revegetation of AymÃ© Kunc Square
Cost: 10000.0 â‚¬
District: 1 - Capitole / Arnaud Bernard / Carmes
Description: Over the years, the AymÃ© Kunc square has lost much of its vegetation due to storms or drought. Just this year, three trees have died (including a young tree that was planted last year and did not survive the heat of this summer). This square deserves to have the dead trees replaced with species adapted to climate change. It also needs replanting of the many other dead shrubs that have never been replaced. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It is proposed to replant 4/5 trees, about twenty shrubs, and also climbing plants on some grilles. In addition, there are plans to replenish the lawn, refurbish the street furniture (benches/trash bins), and possibly add some hardy flowering perennials.

";"- **Urban and Environmental Context**: Toulouse, like many urban areas, faces challenges with heat islands, particularly in highly mineralized zones. Projects aimed at mitigating these effects through green initiatives are generally well-received, as they align with broader environmental concerns and improve living conditions.

- **District Characteristics**: The 16th district, encompassing diverse neighborhoods like Fontaine-Lestang and Mermoz, has varied socio-economic profiles. Projects that enhance communal spaces or address environmental issues can be particularly appealing in such mixed districts.

- **Project Appeal and Visibility**: The project proposes creating green spaces in a highly mineralized area, which is likely to attract votes from residents suffering from heat during the summer months. Its focus on sustainability and urban quality of life may also draw broader support across Toulouse.

- **Cost vs. Budget**: At 250,000 euros, the project's cost is relatively moderate within the total budget of 8 million euros. This makes it more likely to be funded without exhausting budgetary resources, appealing to pragmatic voters who consider project feasibility.

- **Comparative Analysis**: Based on previous participatory budgeting outcomes, projects with environmental impact and moderate costs tend to perform well. Assuming a similar voter turnout and project competition as in previous years, this project could be positioned favorably.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Given that each voter can select up to three projects, those with broad appeal and visible impact, like this one, have a higher chance of gathering votes from a wide demographic.

- **Estimation and Ranking**: Considering these factors, the project might attract a significant portion of the votes, though exact numbers depend on the total number and types of projects submitted. Its cost-effectiveness and appeal should place it in a strong position in the final ranking, though exact placement can vary with the competitive landscape of the election year.

Project: Create pedestrian connections to the CrÃªtes parking lot
Cost: 40000.0 â‚¬
District: 10 - Jolimont / Soupetard / Roseraie / Gloire / Gramont / Amouroux
Description: The CrÃªtes parking lot is today exclusively reserved for vehicle parking; however, this area sees a significant daily flow of pedestrians crossing the parking lot and weaving between vehicles to reach the subway via the pedestrian crossing located on Avenue Yves Brunaud. The idea would be to create a pedestrian continuity within the parking lot to connect the crosswalks located on either side while reintroducing vegetation to the space that is currently exclusively paved. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is acceptable regarding the creation of pedestrian connections, but it is likely that the re-vegetation cannot be carried out in view of the Express Bike Network project.

";"- **Relevance of the Issue**: The project addresses noise pollution, a significant urban issue, especially in busy districts like Amidonniers / Compans-Caffarelli / Brouardel. This relevance could attract a higher number of votes from residents affected by or concerned about environmental and noise issues.

- **Project Cost**: At 31,500 euros, the project is relatively affordable compared to the total budget of 8 million euros. This lower cost might make it more likely to be funded, as it allows for more projects to be selected within the budget constraints.

- **District Characteristics**: District 2 includes areas near the university and business sectors, likely increasing the number of residents who are young, tech-savvy, and possibly more environmentally conscious. This demographic might show greater support for innovative environmental solutions.

- **Voter Engagement**: Historical data on voter turnout and preferences in participatory budgeting in Toulouse suggests variability based on project type and district. Projects with a clear, direct benefit to community well-being or environmental impact tend to perform well.

- **Competition with Other Projects**: The final rank and likelihood of funding also depend on the nature and appeal of competing projects. Without details on other projects, estimating exact rank is challenging but can be approximated based on past trends.

- **Visibility and Campaigning**: The success of the project in the voting phase could also hinge on how effectively it is marketed and communicated to the residents of Toulouse, especially in the relevant district.

Based on these considerations, the project could attract a moderate to high number of votes due to its relevance, affordability, and potential appeal to environmentally conscious voters in a densely populated and active district.

Project: Jacobins/Fermat district: limit traffic and speed with road markings.
Cost: 4000.0 â‚¬
District: 1 - Capitole / Arnaud Bernard / Carmes
Description: Jacobins Convent District / Fermat High Schools: Limit traffic and speed on Lakanal Street (and similar streets) to 10 km/h through the use of speed bumps. The aim is to:
- increase the safety of schoolchildren, high school students, passersby, and tourists
- reduce air pollution for residents
- reduce noise pollution for residents
ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The installation of speed bumps on these roads is not feasible as it is incompatible with the movement of people with reduced mobility. Indeed, since this street is in a meeting zone (limited to 20km/h), it must allow gentle traffic on the roadway, especially for people with reduced mobility, given that the sidewalks are narrow. Note that a comprehensive redevelopment project for Lakanal Street and Maurice Prin Alley is currently under study. Moreover, this area should become more tranquil once the access control at the intersection of Anatole France Square and Deville Street is operational (a coordinated installation as part of the Lois-RÃ©musat sector calming project). Finally, it should be noted that this street is equipped with chicane parking to reduce speed. Nevertheless, it is proposed to reinforce the road markings with pedestrian logos suitable for meeting zones.

";"- **Project Relevance and Appeal**: The project addresses safety, pollution, and noise issues, which are significant concerns in urban areas, particularly around schools. This relevance could attract votes from residents prioritizing these issues.
  
- **Cost Efficiency**: With a relatively low cost of 4000.0 â‚¬, the project is economically feasible within the total budget of 8,000,000 euros. Lower-cost projects might be more appealing as they allow more projects to be funded overall.

- **District Characteristics**: The project is located in District 1, which includes central and historically significant areas like Capitole. Projects in such central districts might attract more attention and, consequently, more votes due to higher population density and engagement.

- **Voter Behavior**: Based on previous participatory budgeting patterns, projects that enhance pedestrian safety and environmental quality tend to be popular. However, the effectiveness of the proposed solution (road markings instead of speed bumps) might be questioned by some voters.

- **Competition and Alternatives**: The presence of other projects, especially those with similar or more effective solutions for traffic and safety, could influence the number of votes this project receives. The ongoing comprehensive redevelopment might also affect voter perception regarding the necessity of this project.

- **Technical Feasibility Concerns**: The note on the infeasibility of speed bumps due to compatibility issues with mobility might deter some voters, although the alternative solution proposed (enhanced road markings) is aimed at addressing the same issues.

- **Historical Voting Data and Trends**: Assuming a similar distribution of votes and types of projects as in previous years, and considering the factors above, the project could be moderately popular but not among the top due to its relatively simple intervention compared to more comprehensive projects.

Project: Greening of the Bourrassol Parking Lot
Cost: 250000.0 â‚¬
District: 6 - Saint-Cyprien
Description: White paint and green bollards mark car parking spaces on several streets in the Bourrassol neighborhood, but these are underused and aesthetically lacking areas. It would be far more beneficial to take advantage of these zones to remove the asphalt, restore access to the soil, and sow wildflowers and other small local species. This would enhance biodiversity, combat heat islands, and bring more beauty to the neighborhood. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A de-asphalting project could be implemented in the existing parking area at the entrance of the street. Trees and flowers could be planted in the parking area at the back of the lot, continuing those existing in the playground area, and would create a vegetated open space set back from the road. This project could eliminate about 19 parking spaces. The remaining parking spaces along Bourrassol street, totaling 27 (including 2 for disabled access and 2 reserved for electric vehicle charging), could be de-asphalted and covered with grassy honeycomb slabs, grassed paving stones, etc. The proposal for greening is not retained for the streets of the Bourrassol neighborhood because this project would be too extensive (the parking spaces being simply marked on the road, are not protected), within the framework of the budget allocated to the participatory budget, and the trees would represent an obstacle on the roadway.

";"- **District Characteristics**: The 11th district, encompassing Bonhoure, GuilhemÃ©ry, ChÃ¢teau de l'Hers, Limayrac, and CÃ´te PavÃ©e, is a diverse area with varying socio-economic profiles. Projects in such districts can attract a broad interest base, potentially increasing voter turnout for initiatives that enhance community spaces.

- **Project Appeal**: The project aims to enhance Raspail Square by adding facilities that promote community interaction and leisure, which are generally popular in urban settings. The inclusion of workout bars, a book-sharing box, compost bins, and chess/checkers tables appeals to a wide demographic, including families, fitness enthusiasts, and environmentally conscious residents.

- **Budget Appropriateness**: At 50,000 euros, the project is modestly priced, making it a feasible choice under the participatory budgeting constraints. This cost-effectiveness can make it more likely to be funded compared to more expensive proposals.

- **Exclusion of the Fountain**: The project's adaptability by excluding the fountain to fit the budget constraints shows practical planning, which might be viewed positively by voters who prefer realistic and achievable projects.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Based on previous participatory budgeting trends, projects that enhance communal spaces tend to perform well. Given the voting system allows selecting up to three projects, voters might include this project as one of their choices due to its direct impact on community quality of life.

- **Competition and Positioning**: The final rank in the list will depend heavily on the nature and appeal of competing projects. However, given the project's broad appeal and practical budget, it is likely to rank in the upper-middle tier if not among the top projects, especially if there are no significantly more compelling or similarly priced projects.

";"- **District and Urgency**: The project is located in District 1, which includes central and historically significant areas like Capitole, Arnaud Bernard, and Carmes. These areas are typically high-traffic with a significant number of residents and visitors, increasing the visibility and perceived importance of the project.

- **Cost-Effectiveness**: The project cost is extremely low (1000.0 â‚¬) compared to the total budget (8,000,000 â‚¬) and other typical project costs. This could make it more likely to be funded as it uses a minimal portion of the budget, allowing for more projects to be funded overall.

- **Safety and Public Interest**: Projects focusing on safety, especially in high-traffic areas, tend to attract more attention and votes due to the direct impact on daily life and general public concern for safety.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Given that each voter can select up to three projects, projects with broad appeal and urgent need, like improving a dangerous intersection, are likely to be prioritized by voters.

- **Competition and Project Scope**: The number of competing projects and their nature (e.g., other safety projects, large-scale infrastructural changes) could influence the ranking and votes. However, the low cost and high impact of this project should keep it competitive.

- **Historical Voting Patterns**: Analyzing past participatory budgeting results could provide insights, but generally, projects with a clear, direct benefit to a large number of people or critical issues tend to perform well.

";"- **Community Engagement**: The project targets chess enthusiasts, a specific but passionate community. This could drive a moderate level of engagement among chess players and spectators, potentially increasing its appeal to a niche audience.

- **Cost-Effectiveness**: With a relatively low cost of 20,000 euros, the project is affordable compared to many other urban projects. This could make it more likely to be funded within the available budget, appealing to voters who prioritize efficient use of funds.

- **District Characteristics**: The 15th district, Croix de Pierre / Route d'Espagne, may have varying levels of community engagement and public space usage. The effectiveness of the project could depend on local demographics and the existing community infrastructure.

- **Comparative Analysis**: Looking at past participatory budgeting results, projects with a clear community benefit and low cost tend to perform well. However, highly specialized projects might not attract the broadest voter base.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Each voter can select up to three projects, which might benefit well-understood and universally appealing projects. A niche project like a chess area might not be everyone's top choice but could gather enough support from its specific audience.

- **Budget Allocation Strategy**: Given the project's low cost, it stands a good chance of being funded after higher-cost projects have exhausted significant portions of the budget. Its position in the ranking might be relatively high if it garners enough votes to justify its cost-effectiveness.

Project: Implement photoluminescent paint marking on the Coubertin and Garigliano Bridges.
Cost: 50000.0 â‚¬
District: 5 - Saint-Michel / Saint-Agne / Empalot / Le Busca / Ile du Ramier / Monplaisir
Description: The idea: to create simple graphic compositions on bike paths using photoluminescent paint that stores daylight and reflects it when night falls for a duration of 10 hours. This is to make the bike path visible at night for about ten hours. The main goal is to secure sections of bike paths at night and to make the bike paths attractive and aesthetic. On Pont Coubertin/Garigliano? ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal to create bike paths with photoluminescent paint may be feasible on the Pierre de Coubertin and Garigliano Bridges. However, there are some reservations: A test was conducted on Velasquez Street and the path of La Crabe in Toulouse in 2022, but this application did not meet expectations regarding the duration of luminescence mentioned in the product sheets. Moreover, this product is not approved for ""standard"" use and can only be used in experiments. The main reasons cited are: 1. The photoluminescent property is barely visible in a place that is already poorly lit, which would be the case on these two bridges equipped with street lamps on either side of the road. 2. The duration of the luminescence is far from the announced 10 hours but rather around 3 hours. 3. The lifespan of the luminescence deteriorates over time. Finally, this process seems very costly considering that it does not provide the expected service.

";"**Reasoning:**

1. **Project Appeal and Practicality**: The project's idea of using photoluminescent paint on bike paths is innovative and aligns with environmental and safety concerns, which could attract voters interested in sustainable and safe urban mobility solutions.

2. **Previous Test Outcomes**: The project's feasibility is questionable based on past tests in Toulouse, where the paint did not perform as expected. This could deter voters who are skeptical about the effectiveness and value of the investment.

3. **Cost vs. Benefit**: At 50,000 euros, the project is relatively low-cost compared to other large-scale urban projects. This might appeal to voters who prefer smaller, less expensive projects. However, the perceived low benefit due to poor past performance might negate this advantage.

4. **District-Specific Interest**: The project is located in District 5, which includes diverse neighborhoods. The specific interest and voter turnout in this district could influence the number of votes.

5. **Voter Behavior in Participatory Budgeting**: Typically, projects that demonstrate clear, tangible benefits and have a broad appeal across different demographics tend to receive more votes. Projects with prior negative results or skepticism might not fare as well.

6. **Competition with Other Projects**: The number of competing projects and their nature (more appealing, more practical, better tested) will also affect this project's ranking. Without knowing the specifics of other projects, a conservative estimate is safer.

7. **General Interest in Cycling and Safety**: Toulouse has a growing interest in cycling infrastructure, which could be a positive factor. However, the specific technology proposed here has shown limitations, which might reduce its appeal.

Your task is to analyze the following project, proposed as part of a new participatory budgeting election in year 2024.

Project: Two-way cycle lane on Rue FalguiÃ¨re
Cost: 50000.0 â‚¬
District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
Description: Cycling against the flow of traffic on Rue de la Concorde and Rue Alexandre FalguiÃ¨re is currently very dangerous with oncoming cars that pass dangerously close. There should be a secure bike lane at least in the opposite direction by removing parking on one side of the street. It is also necessary to consider reducing traffic as much as possible to calm the street. ðŸ”Ž WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Such an arrangement cannot be implemented on Rue de la Concorde, under this scheme, due to the presence of a terrace set up on the sidewalk (establishment Le Concorde) and prior infrastructure works that are incompatible with the deadlines and costs associated with this participatory budget. For Rue FalguiÃ¨re, a contraflow bike lane can be considered but presents the following constraints:
- necessity to move the recently installed planter, in consultation with the residents, at the corner of Rue Saint-Papoul (interruption of the bike lane continuity);
- interruption of the bike lane arrangement at the intersection with Rue de la Concorde (narrowing of the lane at the level of the small square);
- arrangement can only be made after the intersection with Rue Saint-Henri, the 2 lanes on the side of Place Roquelaine must be preserved as part of the project for a green square on the square;
- removal of about twenty parking spaces.

";"- **Urban Mobility and Safety Concerns**: The project addresses a significant issue of cycling safety in a busy district, which is likely to resonate with a broad audience, particularly those concerned with urban mobility and safety.

- **District Popularity and Engagement**: The district involved (Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy) is centrally located and likely has a high level of civic engagement, which could translate into a higher number of votes.

- **Environmental and Urban Planning Trends**: There is a growing trend towards sustainable urban mobility solutions, which includes improving cycling infrastructure. This trend could influence more residents to support such projects.

- **Impact of Project Constraints**: The project has several constraints, such as the need to move planters and the interruption of the bike lane at certain points, which might deter some voters who prefer a more comprehensive solution.

- **Comparison with Past Projects**: Analyzing past participatory budgeting results, projects with a focus on transportation and safety typically perform well, though not always the top-ranked due to budget constraints and the breadth of impact.

- **Cost vs. Budget**: The project cost (50,000 â‚¬) is relatively low compared to the total available budget (8,000,000 â‚¬), making it more likely to be funded even if it doesn't receive the highest number of votes.

- **Voter Behavior and Project Support**: Assuming a moderate level of support based on the factors above, the project could receive a substantial number of votes but might not be among the very top due to its specific and somewhat localized nature.

- **Comparison with Past Trends**: Analyzing past participatory budgeting results, projects with a clear, direct benefit and a moderate cost often rank well. They are not only likely to get funded but also to receive a substantial number of votes.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Each voter can select up to three projects, which means popular, low-cost projects can accumulate votes quickly as they might be commonly chosen as one of the three preferred options by many voters.

- **Budget Algorithm Impact**: The greedy algorithm used in selection favors projects like this one, which are lower in cost, allowing more projects to be funded within the total budget. This can affect both the voting behavior (voters might prefer to vote for projects that are more likely to be funded) and the final ranking.

";"- **District and Demand**: The project is located in District 6 - Saint-Cyprien, a vibrant and densely populated area of Toulouse. The demand for bicycle infrastructure is typically high in urban areas where many residents rely on bicycles for daily commuting.

- **Project Cost and Scope**: The cost of the project is relatively low (360 euros), suggesting it is a small-scale initiative. Smaller projects might attract fewer votes if voters prioritize more impactful or larger-scale projects.

- **Environmental and Social Impact**: The project addresses a clear need for more bike parking, which aligns with broader environmental goals and urban mobility improvements. This could appeal to environmentally conscious voters and daily bike users.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Given that each voter can select up to three projects, projects that address everyday practical needs, like this one, might be included as a secondary choice even if they are not the top priority for some voters.

- **Competition**: The position in the final ranking will also depend on the nature and appeal of other competing projects in the same election. Without details on these, it's challenging to predict the exact rank but a lower-cost, high-utility project could perform well.

- **Historical Data and Trends**: Assuming similar voting patterns to previous years and considering the practical appeal of the project, it might attract a moderate number of votes. However, without specific historical data on similar projects, this remains an estimate.

";"- **Project Appeal**: The Dog Park project targets dog owners, a specific but potentially large group interested in the welfare and social opportunities for their pets. Dog parks are generally popular in urban areas where private gardens are less common.

- **Cost and Funding Feasibility**: At â‚¬15,000, the project is relatively low-cost compared to other urban projects. This makes it more likely to be funded within the available budget, as it allows room for other projects to be funded as well.

- **District Characteristics**: District 7 includes diverse areas but is generally residential with families and individuals likely to own pets. The presence of a park (Parc du Soleil d'Or) already earmarked for expansion makes the project feasible and relevant to local residents.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Given the ability to vote for up to three projects, voters might prioritize projects that directly impact their daily lives and community, such as a dog park. 

- **Comparative Analysis**: In previous participatory budgeting rounds, projects with a clear, direct benefit to a significant portion of the community, especially at a low cost, tend to perform well in terms of votes.

- **Estimation of Votes**: Based on the factors above, the project could attract a significant portion of the voting population, especially from dog owners and park users in the district. However, it's challenging to predict exact numbers without data on similar past projects.

- **Ranking Prediction**: Given its utility, community focus, and low cost, the project might rank relatively high among other proposals, especially if there are no similarly compelling and low-cost projects in the same voting round.

";"- **District and Theme Relevance**: The project is located in the 15th district, Croix de Pierre / Route d'Espagne, which might have specific local needs and voter engagement levels. The environmental theme of the project, focusing on sustainable urban development and groundwater replenishment, aligns well with current global and local urban trends, potentially increasing its appeal.

- **Project Cost**: At 240,000 euros, the project is moderately priced within the typical range of participatory budgeting projects. This cost is neither too low to be considered trivial nor too high to exhaust the budget quickly, making it a feasible choice for many voters concerned with efficient budget allocation.

- **Voter Behavior and Project Appeal**: Based on previous participatory budgeting patterns, projects that address both environmental sustainability and practical benefits (like improved parking facilities) tend to attract a moderate to high number of votes. The project's dual appeal (environmental and practical utility) could enhance its attractiveness.

- **Competition and Budget Constraints**: The total budget is 8,000,000 euros, and the project's cost allows for multiple projects to be funded. However, the competition with other projects and their respective costs and benefits will influence the final ranking. Projects with lower costs and high perceived benefits could rank higher.

- **Historical Voting Data and Trends**: Assuming a similar voter turnout as in 2022 (4,532 voters), and given that each voter can select up to 3 projects, the project needs to be compelling enough to be among the top choices to secure a high number of votes.

- **Estimation and Ranking Methodology**: Estimating the number of votes based on the project's appeal, cost, and competition, and considering typical voter behavior in Toulouse's participatory budgeting, the project might attract a significant portion of the electorate. The final ranking will depend on how many other projects fall within similar cost and appeal brackets and how the budget is allocated using the greedy algorithm.

230;19;181;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives on the official website. A total of 4,532 people voted in the 2022 election..

Once the voting period ends, the projects are ranked according to the number of votes received. The winning projects are then selected using a greedy algorithm: starting with the project that received the most votes, projects are successively added in order of votes, as long as the available budget allows. 

When the remaining budget is not sufficient to fund the next project on the list, the algorithm skips to the next one that can be funded, and so on, until the total budget of 8,000,000 euros is exhausted.

Your task is to analyze the following project, proposed as part of a new participatory budgeting election in year 2024.

Project: Installation of waste bins for dog feces in Sept Deniers

";"- **Local Needs and Project Relevance**: The project addresses a specific need in the Sept Deniers neighborhood, which already has some canine waste dispensers. The addition of three more units could be seen as a moderate improvement, appealing to dog owners and residents concerned about cleanliness.

- **Project Cost and Budget Impact**: With a relatively low cost of 6000 euros, this project is affordable within the large total budget of 8 million euros. This could make it more likely to be funded after higher-cost projects are considered.

- **Voter Engagement and Project Visibility**: Projects that directly impact daily life and the cleanliness of public spaces tend to be popular. However, the impact here is localized to a specific area, which might limit broader appeal.

- **Comparison with Past Projects**: Analyzing previous participatory budgeting outcomes, smaller-scale and lower-cost projects often receive a moderate amount of votes, especially if they address quality-of-life issues.

- **District Characteristics**: The 7th district, including Sept Deniers, might have a specific demographic profile. If the district is active in participatory budgeting and has a high rate of dog ownership, this could increase the project's votes.

- **Voting Dynamics**: Given that each voter can select up to three projects, projects with a clear, direct benefit but lower cost might be commonly chosen as one of the three votes, especially if they do not polarize the electorate.

- **Estimated Votes and Ranking**: Based on these factors, the project might receive a moderate number of votes compared to more universally appealing or impactful projects. Its position in the ranking could be in the mid to lower tier, especially if there are many competing projects with broader appeal or higher impact.

";"**Reasoning:**

1. **District Characteristics**: The project is located in District 17 - Mirail-UniversitÃ© / Reynerie / Bellefontaine, an area that might have a high demand for community and child-friendly projects due to its residential nature.

2. **Project Cost and Scope**: The project cost is relatively low (â‚¬3000), making it more likely to be funded within the available budget. Low-cost projects can appeal to voters as they see a higher likelihood of implementation.

3. **Project Theme**: The focus on improving a children's playground is generally popular as it directly benefits residents with families, enhancing safety and cleanliness.

4. **Voting Trends**: Assuming a similar voter turnout and behavior as in previous years, projects with a community and family focus in densely populated districts tend to receive a moderate to high number of votes.

5. **Competition and Budget Constraints**: The total budget and the number of competing projects will influence the final ranking. Given the low cost, this project might be ranked higher as it allows for more projects to be funded.

6. **Historical Data and Similar Projects**: Without specific historical voting data on similar projects, an estimate is based on general trends observed in community-focused initiatives in similar urban settings.

7. **Estimation Methodology**: The estimated number of votes is derived from considering the project's appeal, cost-effectiveness, and the district's demographic profile. The confidence interval reflects potential variations in voter interest and turnout.
