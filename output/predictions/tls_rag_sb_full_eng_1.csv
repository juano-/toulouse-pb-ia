Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Increase the number of bicycle parking spaces in the city center
- Cost: 12000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 1 - Capitole / Arnaud Bernard / Carmes
- Description: Even though notable efforts have already been made, wanting to develop the modal share of bicycles in transportation requires a significant increase in bike parking options, especially in the city center. Parking spaces are very insufficient around Capitole Square, Wilson Square, St Pierre Square, Arnaud Bernard Square, around St Sernin, Carnot Boulevard, Strasbourg Boulevard, Arcole Boulevard, Alsace-Lorraine Street, Mirepoix Street, Pargamini√®res Street, R√©musat Street, Taur Street, Gambetta Street, etc. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: As part of its urban development projects, the Community systematically integrates fixtures for bike parking. The deployment of urban furniture such as bike racks in the city center is carried out according to the needs reported by local residents and users (requests to the District Mayor or the AlloToulouse platform 05 61 222 222), subject to the opinion of the Architecte des B√¢timents de France and the availability of already very constrained public space. Within this framework, it is proposed to install, at a minimum, fifty bike racks per year in District 1.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Renovation of the bicycle path on Edouard Belin Avenue, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects.

**Analysis of the Project ""Renovation of the bicycle path on Edouard Belin Avenue"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 12 has shown strong support for similar projects, notably the Bike lane on Saint-Exup√©ry Avenue which topped the list with 492 votes.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨250,000, the project is expensive, which might limit its funding chances if the budget becomes constrained.
3. **Project Theme:** Bicycle infrastructure projects have historically performed well in Toulouse, indicating a high level of community interest in such initiatives.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** The most similar project in the same district received the highest votes in the previous election, suggesting a potentially high voter turnout for this project.
5. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, there might be a proportional increase in votes for all projects, but popular themes like bike paths could disproportionately benefit.
6. **Project Urgency and Visibility:** The description highlights significant safety issues, which could increase its appeal to voters concerned about community safety and environmental sustainability.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it's crucial to consider how many other high-cost projects are competing for the same funds.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Mosquito control device taking into account the environment in district 5
- Cost: 10000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 5 - Saint-Michel / Saint-Agne / Empalot / Le Busca / Ile du Ramier / Monplaisir
- Description: All Toulouse residents are daily frustrated by the proliferation of mosquitoes. For public health reasons, we do not want to use insecticides. I propose to massively use natural solutions (bat nests, titmouse cabins, etc.). The idea mainly lies in involving the population by encouraging them to acquire these types of natural solutions. The operating mode could be the same as that implemented for composts. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Principle agreement from the city's animal sector. The type of equipment, their number, and their placement will be studied within the allotted time frame for the realization of the idea, namely 2 years from the vote.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local issues, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing widespread concerns tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Mosquito control device taking into account the environment in district 5"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 5 has shown a relatively high average number of votes per project (76.8 in 2022), suggesting a strong voter engagement which could benefit this project.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨10,000, the project is relatively inexpensive, which increases its likelihood of being funded even if it doesn't secure a top position.
3. **Relevance and Appeal:** The project addresses a common and pressing issue (mosquito control) without using harmful chemicals, aligning with ecological concerns that may appeal to a broad audience.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar mosquito control projects have received a moderate number of votes across different districts, indicating a consistent interest in this type of initiative.
5. **Project Visibility and Support:** The project's success will depend on its visibility and the campaigning done by its proponents. If it is well-promoted, it could gather significant support.
6. **Historical Data on Similar Projects:** Similar projects in the same district, like the ""Nesting Boxes for Tits"" (44 votes, rank 91), suggest that while environmentally themed projects are supported, they don't always reach top ranks.
7. **Expected Higher Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout in the upcoming election, the project might receive more votes than similar past projects, provided it resonates well with the increased voter base.

It is a place that allows everyone to come together, residents of the neighborhood, or those coming from farther districts for the atmosphere at Rangueil. It is also a living space where we meet young people from all walks of life, to exchange and share knowledge... Over time and with increased use, the ramps have deteriorated, increasing the risk of injuries. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The skatepark is in very poor condition and needs renovation. However, since the platform already exists, the amount for the idea remains within the envelope determined by the 2023 participatory budget idea.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Rangueil Skatepark Renovation, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, the cost relative to available budget, and the distribution of votes among competing projects within the same district or with similar themes.

**Analysis of Rangueil Skatepark Renovation:**
1. **District Voting History:** District 13 had a moderate voting turnout in the previous year, with projects like the development of the Pech-David observatory site receiving around 101 votes.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨150,000, the project is moderately expensive, which could affect its funding chances if there are many higher-voted, lower-cost projects.
3. **Project Appeal:** The project targets a specific community (skateboarders), which might limit its broader appeal compared to more universally beneficial projects like greening or general public infrastructure.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in terms of cost and theme (like sports facilities) have received a varied number of votes, generally not exceeding the mid-200s.
5. **Increased Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, there might be a slight increase in votes for all projects, but this will also increase competition.
6. **Project Necessity and Visibility:** The project addresses a clear need (safety and renovation) which could resonate well with local voters, especially youth and sports enthusiasts.
7. **Historical Data from Similar Projects:** Projects with a similar theme or in the same district have not typically broken into the top 10, suggesting a pattern that might repeat unless there's a significant campaign or community mobilization around this project.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Toulouse's Participatory Budgeting**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, who can vote for up to three projects. The projects are then funded in descending order of votes until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters (often related to its utility, visibility, and relevance to a wide audience), the cost of the project (as higher costs can limit funding when budget constraints are tight), and the district's voting patterns and engagement levels.

**Analysis of the Project: Resurface the cycle lanes on the Garonne quaysides**

1. **District Voting Patterns**: District 1 historically shows strong voter turnout and support for projects, especially those related to cycling and pedestrian improvements, as evidenced by the high votes for similar projects in the previous year.
   
2. **Project Theme and Relevance**: The project focuses on improving cycling infrastructure, a recurring and popular theme in Toulouse's participatory budgeting, aligning with ecological and mobility trends in urban European contexts.

3. **Cost Consideration**: At ‚Ç¨201,000, the project is expensive, which could be a limiting factor. However, similar costly projects have been successfully funded in the past when they received enough votes.

4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in the same district, like the creation of dedicated bike and pedestrian paths, received high votes (467 votes), suggesting a strong community interest in cycling infrastructure.

5. **Project Visibility and Impact**: The project affects a prominent area along the Garonne, likely increasing its visibility and perceived impact among voters, potentially driving higher voter support.

6. **Budget Constraints**: With a total budget of ‚Ç¨8,000,000 and considering the project's cost, it needs to secure a high number of votes to be funded, given the competition with 182 other projects.

7. **Historical Data and Trends**: Analyzing past data, projects in District 1 that focus on mobility and green initiatives tend to perform well, suggesting a favorable outcome for this project.

8. **Potential Voter Increase**: With an expected higher turnout, there might be more votes available, which could benefit well-publicized and broadly appealing projects like this one.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Increased use of photovoltaic and wind energy on public buildings, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of votes across various projects and districts.

**Analysis of the Project ""Increased use of photovoltaic and wind energy on public buildings"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 19 had a moderate voting engagement in the previous election, with the highest voted project receiving 130 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of community engagement but not the highest.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is relatively expensive, which might deter votes if voters are concerned about budget allocation.
3. **Environmental Appeal:** The project has a strong ecological component, aligning with global trends towards sustainability, which could attract a significant number of votes, especially from environmentally conscious voters.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects like ""Long live solar energy on the rooftops of public buildings!"" in District 20 received 90 votes. This suggests a decent level of interest in sustainable projects, although the higher cost of this project might impact its vote count.
5. **Project Visibility and Impact:** The project targets public buildings, which could enhance its visibility and perceived impact, potentially increasing voter interest.
6. **Previous District Projects' Performance:** The most voted project in this district in the previous election was significantly less costly and received 130 votes. Given the higher cost and similar theme, this project might attract fewer votes.
7. **Overall Voter Turnout and Project Count:** With an increased voter turnout expected and a total of 183 projects, the competition for votes will be intense, possibly spreading out the vote more thinly across projects.

298;311;7;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Creation of a contraflow bike lane on Bertrand de Born street (section Canal du Midi / Place Belfort)
- Cost: 60000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
- Description: I propose the greening and the establishment of a bicycle lane on Bertrand de Born street. This project, in adaptation to climate change, includes: - eco-mobility with the bicycle lane and the removal of parking spaces. Moreover, the presence of 5 private and 3 public parking lots meets the needs of the residents - the creation of green islands (without affecting the networks) is part of nature in the city and biodiversity: creating shade for the summer. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The development of a bicycle lane from the Canal du Midi to Place Belfort can be considered. Such a project would remove about 34 parking spaces, 2 delivery spots, 1 space for Persons with Reduced Mobility, and bicycle parking. The terrace area of an establishment would also need to be modified. However, the greening of the street cannot be considered due to the presence of numerous networks: their diversion requires a budget incompatible with that allocated under this participatory budget. Finally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be proposed to residents to green this street. This initiative, after agreement from the concerned property owners, is subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and pedestrian continuity to be respected. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the technical services of the city hall and the metropolis, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects. Projects in districts with higher engagement and voter turnout tend to perform better, as do projects that address widely felt needs or innovative solutions.

**Analysis of the Project: Creation of a contraflow bike lane on Bertrand de Born street**
1. **District Voting History**: District 3 has shown moderate engagement in previous participatory budgeting, with projects receiving an average of around 75 votes, suggesting a solid base of active participants.
2. **Project Cost**: At ‚Ç¨60,000, the project is moderately priced, which could allow it to be funded after higher-cost projects have exhausted a significant portion of the budget.
3. **Theme Relevance**: The project focuses on eco-mobility and urban greening, themes that have historically resonated well with voters in Toulouse, as seen in similar past projects.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in the same district, like the greening and bike lane projects, received between 64 to 95 votes. This project, being moderately ambitious and less disruptive (lower cost and impact on parking), might attract a similar or slightly higher interest.
5. **Expected Voter Turnout Increase**: With an expected higher turnout, the project might benefit from increased overall engagement, although this also means more competition.
6. **Project Visibility and Impact**: The project's impact on a popular area (Canal du Midi to Place Belfort) could enhance its visibility and appeal, potentially increasing voter support.
7. **Technical and Social Feasibility**: The project's feasibility and limited disruption (compared to larger scale greening projects) might make it more attractive to voters who prefer practical and immediate improvements.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Improve pedestrian access from the Rangueil cable car to the Pech David leisure base (200m)
- Cost: 250000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 13 - Rangueil / Sauzelong / Jules-Julien / Pech-David / Pouvourville
- Description: Today, when one wants to go to the Pech David leisure base from the Rangueil Cable Car Station, the route is complicated and not at all signposted. You really need to know the place well to understand how to get there on foot or by bike. Therefore, I propose improving access to Pech David by creating new, clear paths from the cable car station to the leisure base. The paths must accommodate both pedestrians and cyclists. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It is possible to create 200 meters of pedestrian pathway with the maximum budget per idea for my neighborhood in 2023.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its cost relative to the budget, and its relevance to community needs. Projects with higher votes get priority in funding, but very expensive projects may not be funded if they exceed the remaining budget.

**Analysis of the Project ""Improve pedestrian access from the Rangueil cable car to the Pech David leisure base (200m)"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 13 had an average vote of 55.7 per project in 2022, indicating moderate engagement.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is relatively expensive, which could be a limiting factor given the total budget constraints.
3. **Similar Projects:** Similar projects in the same district like the ""Greenway to Pech David"" received 93 votes and ranked 38th, suggesting a decent interest in infrastructure improvements in this area.
4. **Project Relevance:** The project addresses a clear need for better pedestrian and cyclist access, which aligns with broader urban mobility and environmental trends, potentially increasing its appeal.
5. **Competition:** With 183 projects proposed in the current election, the competition might dilute the votes, affecting the chances of securing a top position.
6. **Voter Turnout and Behavior:** An expected higher turnout could increase the total votes, but also spread them across more projects.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the high cost, even with a good number of votes, the project might struggle to be funded if earlier projects consume a significant portion of the budget.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Wildlife Shelters, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm that prioritizes projects in descending order of votes until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects.

**Analysis of the project ""Wildlife Shelters"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 13 had an average vote count of 55.7 in 2022, indicating moderate voter engagement compared to other districts.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** The project's cost (‚Ç¨10,000) is relatively low, making it a financially feasible choice under the greedy algorithm, especially if it garners sufficient votes.
3. **Thematic Relevance:** The project aligns with ecological and environmental themes, which have shown popularity in similar past projects across the city, such as mosquito control and greening projects.
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Similar projects like ""Tiger mosquito traps"" in the same district received 91 votes, suggesting a baseline interest in ecological interventions.
5. **Project Appeal:** The project's focus on creating a sustainable urban ecosystem could appeal to environmentally conscious voters, potentially increasing its vote count.
6. **Competition:** With 183 projects in the upcoming election and an expected higher turnout, the competition might be stiffer, affecting the project's ability to secure a top position.
7. **Historical Data:** Projects with similar themes and costs have generally received moderate to high votes, suggesting a potential for this project to perform well if marketed effectively.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Pedestrians, bicycles, and buses on Boulevard Riquet
- Cost: 250000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
- Description: Calming of Boulevard Riquet by separating uses through the creation of (1) a dedicated bus lane; (2) a bicycle lane (isolated track replacing a car lane on the roadway, using tactical urbanism if necessary), thus separated from pedestrians (who will walk more peacefully along the Canal), as along Boulevard Monplaisir. Development to be created from the Saint-Aubin footbridge (or earlier from the Genes Lougnon barracks) to the All√©es Jean-Jaur√®s. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: In the context of this call for ideas, given the associated deadlines and budget, it is not possible to carry out a development along the entire stretch from the Genes Lougnon barracks to the All√©es Jean-Jaur√®s. However, pending the implementation of the Grand Parc Canal project, which aims to reorganize and secure movements along the canals (pedestrians, cyclists, public transport, cars), and in order to already improve the conflicts of use along the canal and thus the movements of pedestrians, punctual interventions can be considered at the most sensitive spots that will have been previously defined. Also, between the Constantine Bridge and the Riquet Bridge, the development of a one-way bicycle lane could be studied: note that such a development would eliminate about 45 parking spaces.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Pedestrians, bicycles, and buses on Boulevard Riquet, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects that resonate with a wide audience or address pressing community issues tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of the Project ""Pedestrians, bicycles, and buses on Boulevard Riquet"":**
1. **District Voting History:** The district (3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy) has shown moderate interest in similar projects, with related projects receiving a range of 64 to 95 votes in the previous year.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is relatively expensive, which might limit its feasibility under the budget constraints unless it garners significant voter support.
3. **Project Theme:** The focus on multi-modal transportation improvements (buses, bicycles, pedestrians) aligns with popular themes in other districts, suggesting potential for high voter interest.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in terms of theme and district have received decent support, but none have broken into the top ranks, possibly due to their high costs or specific local interests.
5. **Voter Turnout and Engagement:** With an expected higher turnout, there might be more votes available, but this also increases competition among the projects.
6. **Project Visibility and Urgency:** The project addresses a visible and practical issue which could be seen as urgent, potentially increasing its appeal.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of this project, it would need a substantial number of votes to justify its funding over less expensive projects.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Installation of shade structures on rue Pargamini√®res
- Cost: 150000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 1 - Capitole / Arnaud Bernard / Carmes
- Description: Create shade first. Install shade structures on Rue Pargamini√®re and misters during heatwaves. All the merchants on the street turn on their air conditioners, thereby raising the street's temperatures. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: To cool down Rue Pargamini√®res, it is proposed to position a shade structure. However, such an installation requires studies in terms of technical feasibility (anchor tests - attachment structure on the facades, agreement from various condominium syndicates for the installation of the attachments, preliminary work with emergency services). Moreover, the approval of such a project must gather the favorable opinion of the Architecte des B√¢timents de France. Regarding the misters, the study of technical constraints (presence of a potable water source) will define the feasibility of installing these devices.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

305;276;12;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Toulouse's Participatory Budgeting**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, who can vote for up to three projects. The projects are then funded in descending order of votes until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters (often reflected in its utility, visibility, and relevance to a wide demographic), the cost of the project (as more expensive projects might exhaust the budget faster), and the distribution of votes across projects (where projects in districts with higher voter engagement or fewer competing projects might fare better).

**Analysis of ""Create a continuity of the Argoulets green flow beneath the Agde road""**

1. **District Voting History**: District 10 had a relatively high average vote count in the previous year (71.4), suggesting a moderately engaged voter base which could benefit this project.
2. **Project Cost**: At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is on the higher end of the cost spectrum, which might make it harder to fund within the budget constraints if many other projects also receive high votes.
3. **Project Theme and Relevance**: The project focuses on improving pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure, which aligns with popular themes from the previous year, such as bike lanes and green spaces, potentially increasing its appeal.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in terms of theme and district have received a decent number of votes (e.g., Renovation of the Parc des Argoulets with 134 votes), suggesting a supportive environment for this type of project.
5. **Expected Higher Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, there might be a broader distribution of votes, which could either dilute the voting pool or increase total votes for popular projects.
6. **Visibility and Utility**: The project promises significant utility for daily commuters and residents, enhancing its visibility and potential voter appeal.
7. **Political Context**: The mention of lacking ""political will"" might resonate with voters who are eager to see tangible changes, potentially boosting voter support.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Pumptrack Project near the Ernest Renan skate park
- Cost: 250000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 9 - Trois Cocus / Borderouge / Croix-Daurade / Pal√©ficat / Grand Selve
- Description: The Ernest Renan skatepark is currently in poor condition. However, it has a very good location that could allow it to become a major hub for skating and the youth of Toulouse, in an area lacking in facilities for young people. It could be paired with a pumptrack consisting of a track, a series of bumps and banked turns, usable for many skating sports - longboards, rollerblades, scooters - and accessible to all ages and skill levels. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The size of the pumptrack will be adapted to the available space. The estimated cost does not include the refurbishment of the skatepark, but only the creation of a pumptrack.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Pumptrack Project near the Ernest Renan skate park, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing more widely felt needs tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of the Pumptrack Project near the Ernest Renan skate park:**
1. **District Voting History:** District 9 has shown moderate engagement in previous elections, with the highest voted project receiving 111 votes. This suggests a moderate level of voter participation and interest.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨250,000, the project is relatively expensive, which could be a significant factor since higher-cost projects need a substantial number of votes to justify their budget allocation.
3. **Project Appeal:** The project targets youth and sports enthusiasts, which could be appealing but might not have as broad an appeal as projects targeting more general infrastructure improvements.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar sports and youth-oriented projects have received a varied number of votes, often not enough to secure top positions unless they were particularly compelling or well-promoted.
5. **Historical Data from Similar District Projects:** Projects in the same district with costs over ‚Ç¨100,000 have struggled to rank high, suggesting that the high cost of the Pumptrack project might limit its voting potential.
6. **General Appeal and Utility:** While the project serves a specific community segment (youth and sports enthusiasts), its appeal might not be as universal as projects that address broader issues like transportation or general environmental improvements.
7. **Expected Increased Turnout:** An expected higher turnout could either dilute the impact of dedicated supporters if the project does not resonate broadly, or it could enhance its votes if effectively campaigned.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Massive Greening on Raymond IV Street
- Cost: 200000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
- Description: Raymond IV Street is 14 meters wide and currently lacks any greenery. To mitigate the extreme heat on this street during summer, it would be interesting to replace parking spaces with planting pits to accommodate large trees along the entire length of the street, thereby creating a true canopy. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Planting (14/15 trees) in parking spaces may be considered on the odd-numbered side, subject to the approval of the architect of the buildings of France. On the even-numbered side, the presence of numerous networks does not allow for the creation of pits to accommodate trees. This project would eliminate about 15 parking spaces. On the occasion of this redevelopment, the implementation of a bicycle lane on the even-numbered side can also be studied. Finally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green this street. This initiative, after agreement from the concerned owners, is subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and pedestrian continuity to be respected. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the technical services of the city hall and the metropolis, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of votes among competing projects within the same district or thematic area.

**Analysis of the Project: Massive Greening on Raymond IV Street**
1. **District Voting History**: The district (3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy) has shown moderate interest in greening projects, with similar projects receiving around 95 votes on average.
2. **Project Cost**: At ‚Ç¨200,000, the project is relatively expensive, which might limit its ability to be funded unless it garners significantly high votes.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar greening projects in the same district have received between 65 to 95 votes, suggesting a potential voting range for this project.
4. **Project Appeal**: The project addresses a common concern of urban heat and lack of green spaces, which could appeal to environmentally conscious voters.
5. **Voter Turnout and Distribution**: With an expected higher turnout and each voter having up to 3 votes, the project might benefit if it effectively captures the district's growing environmental awareness.
6. **Budget Constraints**: Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it needs to secure a high number of votes to be considered for funding, especially as it competes against other high-cost projects.
7. **Project Visibility and Awareness**: The success of the project will also depend on how well it is marketed and the public's awareness of its benefits, which could influence its final vote count.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Greening of the entire Rue des Fontaines
- Cost: 250000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 6 - Saint-Cyprien
- Description: Objective of revitalizing the street. Making the street more pleasant, conducive to the presence of life, and contributing to the thermal regulation of the neighborhood (micro-climatic rebalancing). A few simple proposals, whose effectiveness is well established, include: Tree planting and vegetation through adapted strata. De-impermeabilization and reduction of car parking spaces. Biological reactivation of targeted soils. Increase in bicycle parking spaces. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is accepted, subject to feasibility in view of the presence of underground networks. Similarly, the form that this greening will take will be specified according to the constraints of the networks: tree planting, planters with climbing plants on supports, or standard-formed trees. These developments will result in the removal of about 17 car parking spaces. This project will also be submitted for review by the Architecte des B√¢timents de France. Additionally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green these streets. However, the agreement of each owner is mandatory to green their front facade. The owner must also commit to maintaining the pits over the long term. Moreover, this initiative will be subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and the need to maintain pedestrian continuity. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the city and metropolitan technical services. More information at: https://metropole.toulouse.fr/actualites/des-fleurs-sur-mon-mur

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects. Projects in districts with historically higher engagement or those addressing widely felt issues tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Greening of the entire Rue des Fontaines"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 6 - Saint-Cyprien has shown strong support for greening and urban improvement projects, suggesting a positive reception.
2. **Cost Consideration:** At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is expensive, which might limit its feasibility under budget constraints, especially when competing against lower-cost projects.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects in the same district received a moderate to high number of votes, such as the greening of Roguet/St Cyprien square (161 votes) and pedestrian redevelopment (206 votes).
4. **Project Appeal:** The project's focus on enhancing urban living through greening and reducing car spaces aligns with contemporary urban trends and environmental concerns, likely increasing its appeal.
5. **Voter Turnout and Engagement:** An expected higher turnout could benefit well-publicized and broadly appealing projects like this one.
6. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of this project, it's crucial to consider how many similarly or higher-priced projects are also highly voted, as this could influence whether there's enough budget left when this project's turn comes.
7. **Historical Data on Voting:** Projects in this district and of this nature tend to rank well but not always in the top positions, especially when they are among the more expensive options.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Skate park renovation and development of communal lands along the railway track
- Cost: 250000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 9 - Trois Cocus / Borderouge / Croix-Daurade / Pal√©ficat / Grand Selve
- Description: Since the abandonment of the Biomass power plant project, the lands owned by the city hall along the railway and Ernest Renan Street have been neglected. A comprehensive redevelopment project into quality green or sports spaces for the residents of the neighborhood would be a real added value. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: This idea is somewhat similar to idea 7297, which involves enhancing the sports facilities on Ernest Renan Street. However, it proposes a redevelopment of the existing structures with the creation of a quality green space, not the creation of a pumptrack. Skate park renovation: 200,000.00 including tax + development of the surroundings: 50,000.00 including tax.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Skate park renovation and development of communal lands along the railway track, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widespread concerns tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of the Skate Park Renovation Project:**
1. **District Voting History:** District 9 had moderate voter engagement in 2022, with the highest-voted project receiving 111 votes. This suggests a reasonable but not outstanding level of community participation.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is relatively expensive, which could be a significant factor given the total budget constraint and the cost of competing projects.
3. **Project Appeal:** The project combines sports and green space development, which could appeal to a broad demographic, potentially increasing its vote count.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in other districts received a moderate number of votes (e.g., 205 votes for a sports complex in District 10). However, expensive projects in District 9 did not fare as well in the rankings.
5. **Expected Higher Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout in the upcoming election, there might be a slight increase in votes for all projects, but this will also increase competition.
6. **Project Visibility and Marketing:** The success of the project could also hinge on how well it is marketed to the electorate, especially in a district with previously moderate engagement.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the project's high cost, even with a good number of votes, it might be skipped if earlier projects exhaust the budget.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Installation of shade structures over the children's play area at La Maourine
- Cost: 120000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 9 - Trois Cocus / Borderouge / Croix-Daurade / Pal√©ficat / Grand Selve
- Description: The playgrounds in Parc de la Maourine are very exposed to the sun. The idea would be to install shade structures above the play equipment, especially the slides, so that they can be used all day long in summer. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal is to install wind-resistant shade structures as has already been done in other playgrounds (Borderouge). At Maourine, given the layout of the playground which includes a significant variety of different modules, a single shade structure will not suffice. Given the investment, the quote will allow for a precise refinement of the potential coverage area.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of votes across various projects and districts. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project: Installation of Shade Structures Over the Children's Play Area at La Maourine**

1. **District Voting History**: District 9 had a moderate average vote count in the previous election, with projects receiving between 10 to 111 votes. This suggests a moderate level of engagement.
   
2. **Project Cost and Appeal**: The project cost (‚Ç¨120,000) is substantial but reasonable for infrastructure improvements. The project addresses a practical need (protection from sun), which is likely to have broad appeal to families and regular park users.

3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: A similar, less expensive project in the same district (shade veils for ‚Ç¨10,000) received 34 votes. Given the higher cost and possibly greater impact of the new project, it might attract more attention and votes.

4. **Voter Turnout and Distribution**: With an expected higher turnout and each voter having up to three votes, projects that resonate well with the community's immediate needs can expect higher vote counts.

5. **Project Visibility and Relevance**: The project's relevance during summer and its impact on children's comfort could make it a popular choice among voters, particularly parents.

6. **Historical Data on Voting**: Projects in the 2022 election with costs around ‚Ç¨100,000-‚Ç¨150,000 received votes ranging widely but generally not breaking into the top ranks unless they had broad appeal or addressed urgent needs.

7. **Estimated Positioning**: Considering the moderate popularity of similar projects and the district's voting history, this project might not break into the top 5 but has a potential to be in the top 10 if it resonates well with the voters.

8. **Budget Constraints**: Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it is feasible to be funded if it ranks well within the top projects, assuming no drastic changes in the budget allocation strategy.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Greening of tree bases on Avenue des Minimes
- Cost: 23000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 8 - Minimes / Barri√®re de Paris / Ponts-Jumeaux / La Vache / Raisins / Fondeyre
- Description: From the Minimes bridge to the Minimes church, in order to make the avenue more attractive and welcoming and to reintroduce vegetation and biodiversity to the city, the bases of the planted trees can host green shrubs as in other parts of the city. Currently, the bases of the trees are used as dumping grounds for cardboard or garbage bags. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Planting shrubs does not seem suitable. It would be better to favor the planting of ground cover plants (such as rosemary, ivy, periwinkle, sea thrift...). To limit trampling and other damage, the installation of protective fencing is necessary.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project

315;249;19;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Improve the cycling continuity on lower Jean Rieux
- Cost: 50000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 11 - Bonhoure / Guilhem√©ry / Ch√¢teau de l'Hers / Limayrac / C√¥te Pav√©e
- Description: The intersection at the bottom of Jean Rieux street, where it meets Port Saint Sauveur and the bridge on rue du Pont Montaudran, is a crucial multimodal transition point where pedestrians, bicycles, cars, and scooters intersect, and the traffic is extremely complex and potentially dangerous. I propose a redesign of the bike lanes in this area to better accommodate the various uses and improve access to Port St Sauveur, Jean Rieux, B. Mul√©, and Port Montaudran streets. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is feasible at the intersection, near the bridge, with the creation of new ground markings.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Improve the cycling continuity on lower Jean Rieux, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to a broad or specific audience, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects.

**Analysis of ""Improve the cycling continuity on lower Jean Rieux"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 11 has shown moderate engagement in previous elections, with projects receiving up to 103 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of community involvement.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨50,000, the project is moderately priced, which could allow it to be funded after higher-voted but more expensive projects are passed over due to budget constraints.
3. **Relevance and Urgency:** The project addresses traffic and safety, which are typically high-priority issues for urban residents, potentially increasing its appeal.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in other districts have received a range of votes (43 to 178), suggesting variability based on district-specific factors and project specifics.
5. **Historical Data from Similar Projects in the District:** Projects with similar themes and costs in the same district have garnered between 68 to 103 votes, indicating a potential voting range for this project.
6. **Overall Voter Turnout and Project Count:** With an increased number of projects (183) and expected higher turnout, competition might be stiffer, possibly diluting the vote across more projects.
7. **Project Visibility and Promotion:** The success of the project could also hinge on how well it is promoted within the community and its perceived impact compared to other projects.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Toulouse's Participatory Budgeting**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, with each resident allowed to vote for up to three projects. The projects are then funded in descending order of votes until the budget limit is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to the total budget, and the distribution of votes among competing projects.

**Analysis of the Project: Planting Trees Along Jean Brunhes Boulevard**

1. **District Voting History**: District 19 has shown moderate interest in similar greening projects, with the highest voted similar project receiving 130 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of community interest in environmental improvements.

2. **Project Cost**: At ‚Ç¨100,000, the project's cost is moderate and comparable to other projects that have been successfully funded in the past, making it financially feasible within the budget constraints.

3. **Similar Projects**: Similar greening projects across the city have received a range of votes, generally not exceeding 150 votes. This sets a likely upper boundary for the expected votes.

4. **Project Appeal**: The project's focus on reducing heat effects and improving aesthetics could appeal to environmentally conscious voters, potentially increasing its vote count.

5. **Competition**: With 9 projects in the district and 183 city-wide, the competition is significant. However, the project's moderate cost and ecological benefits might help it stand out.

6. **Voter Turnout and Distribution**: An expected higher turnout could increase the total votes, but also means votes may be more distributed among the larger number of projects.

7. **Historical Data and Ranking**: Analyzing similar projects and their rankings, projects with around 100 votes tend to rank around the middle of the list, suggesting a likely position outside the top 10 but within the top half.

8. **Project Specifics and Community Impact**: The project's specific focus on replacing parking spaces might face some resistance, potentially affecting its total votes.

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing popular themes like green spaces and community facilities tend to perform better.

**Analysis of ""A place of conviviality in the courtyard of the Le Crat√®re cinema"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 5 has shown strong support for community and green space projects, with average votes per project relatively high compared to other districts.
2. **Project Theme and Appeal:** The project's focus on greening and community space aligns well with previously successful themes in the district and citywide.
3. **Cost Efficiency:** At ‚Ç¨30,000, the project is moderately priced, which could allow it to be funded even after higher-cost projects, increasing its chances of selection.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in terms of theme and cost have received a decent number of votes, suggesting a baseline popularity for such initiatives.
5. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, projects that resonate well with community values, like this one, might see a proportional increase in votes.
6. **Project Visibility and Engagement:** The project's plan to design in a participatory manner with users could increase its visibility and voter engagement, potentially boosting its vote count.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it is likely affordable within the budget constraints after funding higher-vote, higher-cost projects.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of Tree Plantations Parc de la Maourine and Place Froidure:**
1. **District Voting History:** District 9 had moderate voter engagement in 2022, with the highest voted project receiving 111 votes. This suggests a reasonable but not outstanding level of community participation.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨42,000, the cost of this project is moderate, making it more feasible to be funded within the budget constraints compared to more expensive proposals.
3. **Project Theme:** Environmental and greening projects have shown varied success across the city, but they generally attract a decent amount of support, especially in the context of increasing urban green spaces.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects in other districts received votes ranging from 35 to 135, suggesting a potential for moderate popularity.
5. **District's Average Vote:** The average vote for projects in District 9 was lower compared to more central or affluent districts, which might limit the upper potential of votes this project could receive.
6. **Project Appeal:** The project addresses a visible and tangible need (replacing dead trees), which could enhance its appeal to local residents.
7. **Expected Turnout Increase:** With an expected higher turnout in the upcoming election, there might be a slight increase in votes for all projects, potentially benefiting this project as well.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Installation of uritrottoirs in the Belfort/Bayard district
- Cost: 8000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
- Description: Implement Uritrottoirs in the streets around Belfort Square/rue Bayard (near the bars) to avoid persistent odors and to collect urine in planters to make our streets more pleasant. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Such equipment is already in operation near Belfort Square, at 1 rue de l‚ÄôOrient. Note that the installation of a Uritrottoir is subject to various constraints: not overly restricting the width of the sidewalk, no underground networks... The notion of acceptability with the residents must also be considered (directly opposite the device, at the corner of streets which could surprise a passerby...). Therefore, locations near schools are to be excluded. For the mentioned area, the corners of Guillemin Tarayre and Agathoise streets as well as Laffite/Bertrand de Born streets are among the pre-identified sites.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project

Before giving your answer, take time to reason thoroughly, but only explain the essential reasoning.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Installation of uritrottoirs in the Belfort/Bayard district, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing widely felt issues tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Installation of Uritrottoirs in the Belfort/Bayard District:**
1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The project's low cost (‚Ç¨8,000) compared to the total budget and other projects increases its likelihood of being funded.
2. **District Voting History**: District 3 had a moderate average vote count in 2022, suggesting a reasonable level of voter engagement which could benefit this project.
3. **Similar Project Performance**: A similar project in a different district received 36 votes and ranked 106th, indicating moderate interest which might translate similarly or slightly better in District 3 due to its context.
4. **Community Relevance**: The project addresses a specific local issue (odors near bars), which could resonate well with local voters, especially those directly affected by the problem.
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Projects with a greening focus in the same district received significantly higher votes (ranging from 64 to 95 votes), suggesting that environmental enhancements are valued, although this project's focus on sanitation might not appeal as broadly.
6. **Visibility and Awareness**: The project's success will depend heavily on how well it is communicated and whether the community perceives uritrottoirs as an effective solution.
7. **Potential Controversy**: The acceptability of uritrottoirs to residents could be a limiting factor, as noted in the project description. Projects with potential for controversy typically have more variable outcomes.

311;216;24;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Arrange traffic on the Guilhem√©ry Bridge for pedestrians and cyclists
- Cost: 150000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 11 - Bonhoure / Guilhem√©ry / Ch√¢teau de l'Hers / Limayrac / C√¥te Pav√©e
- Description: Near a large educational institution, this complex and densely frequented intersection is designed only for cars. However, it is also heavily used by pedestrians and bicycles. Currently, due to the lack of clearly defined cycling facilities (as on the Pont Montaudran), sidewalks are increasingly being used by two-wheelers. Let's delineate and secure spaces, so that everyone can move safely, which will also encourage cycling in the city. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A study for a minor reconfiguration of this bridge is underway as part of the project to convert Port Saint Etienne to Grand Rond to two-way traffic, accompanying phase 2 of the civil engineering works (mid-2025 to mid-2026) for the future Fran√ßois Verdier line C station. This will result in a dead end on Rue des Fr√®res Lion. This idea will therefore be part of this study aimed at improving pedestrian, bicycle, and public transport mobility, with a possible upgrade to the traffic lights standards.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Arrange traffic on the Guilhem√©ry Bridge for pedestrians and cyclists, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to a broad or specific audience, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing widespread issues like transportation or green spaces tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Arrange traffic on the Guilhem√©ry Bridge for pedestrians and cyclists"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 11 had a moderate average vote count in the previous election, with top projects receiving between 103 and 5 votes. This suggests a moderately engaged voting population.
2. **Project Cost and Budget Impact:** The project cost (‚Ç¨150,000) is substantial but not among the highest, which could allow it to be funded without exhausting the budget quickly.
3. **Relevance and Current Trends:** The project addresses urban mobility and safety for pedestrians and cyclists, which aligns with broader social and environmental trends and could attract a significant number of votes.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects, especially those enhancing bike and pedestrian infrastructure, have received a wide range of votes, from very high (492 votes) to moderate (around 50-100 votes). This variability suggests that success heavily depends on specific project details and local voter priorities.
5. **Project Visibility and Urgency:** Located near a large educational institution, the project could be seen as urgent and beneficial, potentially increasing its appeal.
6. **Competition Within the District:** With 10 projects in the district, competition is moderate. The project's success will partly depend on the nature of competing proposals.
7. **Expected Higher Turnout:** A higher turnout could increase the total votes for all projects but might not disproportionately benefit any single project unless it has broad appeal.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing widespread concerns tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Installation of bat and swift boxes around Purpan Hospital"":**

3. **Relevance and Appeal:** The project addresses biodiversity and mosquito control, which are relevant urban issues. Similar projects have shown decent popularity across the city.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in other districts received between 49 to 155 votes. Given the moderate cost and ecological focus, this project might attract a similar level of interest.
5. **Expected Voter Turnout Increase:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might gain additional visibility and votes, although this also increases competition.
6. **Project Uniqueness and Urgency:** The project's focus on biodiversity through practical measures could stand out as both unique and urgent, appealing to environmentally conscious voters.
7. **Historical Data from Similar Projects:** Projects with a focus on mosquito control and biodiversity enhancement generally ranked well but varied significantly based on district and project specifics.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Greening of Rue de Cugnaux
- Cost: 250000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 6 - Saint-Cyprien
- Description: Create greening areas (like on the street leading from J Diebold space to Ravelin square) with the possibility to plant trees or set up flowers. And let the local residents maintain them! üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea of greening Cugnaux street has been accepted, provided that the presence of networks allows it. Similarly, the form that this greening will take will be refined according to the constraints of the networks: planting of trees, planters with climbing plants on supports, or standard-formed trees. These developments will result in the removal of about 17 car parking spaces. This project will also be submitted for review by the Architecte des B√¢timents de France. Additionally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green these streets. However, the agreement of each owner is mandatory to green their front facade. The owner must also commit to maintaining the pits in the long term. Moreover, this initiative will be subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and the need to maintain pedestrian continuity. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the city and metropolitan technical services, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Avenue de la Gloire by the cemetery wall: bringing ""life"" back to the abandoned planters
- Cost: 250000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 10 - Jolimont / Soupetard / Roseraie / Gloire / Gramont / Amouroux
- Description: The cemetery wall is lined with planters abandoned due to chronic drought. However, plants manage to grow there. The idea is to assemble a team of volunteers to plant drought-resistant species (e.g., sedum), maintain them in coordination with the technical services and according to a specification. This is in the same spirit as the teams for community composting (coordinator, training...). In the end, we will have plants in these planters rather than abandoned soil. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Considering the length of the wall, it is possible to refurbish half of the planters within the 2023 budget limit by idea for my neighborhood.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Avenue de la Gloire by the cemetery wall: bringing ""life"" back to the abandoned planters, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Avenue de la Gloire by the cemetery wall"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 10 has shown moderate voter engagement with an average vote count of 71.4 per project in 2022, which is above the city's lower quartile but below the top performers.
2. **Cost Consideration:** The project cost of ‚Ç¨250,000 is relatively high, which could be a significant factor since it consumes a considerable portion of the budget compared to other projects.
3. **Project Theme:** The project focuses on environmental improvement, which aligns with popular themes such as greening and sustainability seen in previous successful projects across the city.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects have received a wide range of votes, but generally, more modestly priced projects have fared better.
5. **Expected Higher Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might gain more votes, but this also increases competition among the projects.
6. **Project Impact and Visibility:** The project's success depends on its ability to resonate with a broad audience, given its specific location and the nature of the improvement.
7. **Historical Data from Similar Projects:** Projects with similar themes in the district, like the Renovation of the Parc des Argoulets, received substantial support (134 votes), suggesting a good base level of community interest in environmental enhancements.

300;210;29;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to public concerns, and its cost relative to the budget. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing widespread issues tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Fighting the Invasion of Tiger Mosquitoes in Soupetard"":**
1. **Cost Efficiency**: The project's low cost (‚Ç¨1000) makes it highly feasible within the budget, allowing it to be funded even late in the allocation process.
2. **Relevance and Urgency**: Addressing health and comfort by controlling mosquitoes is a pressing and relatable issue for many residents, likely increasing its appeal.
3. **Previous Similar Projects**: Similar mosquito control projects have received moderate to high support, such as ""Mosquito Control"" in District 12 with 258 votes.
4. **District Voting History**: District 10 has shown decent engagement, with projects like ""A sports complex in an urban area"" receiving 205 votes.
5. **Comparative Advantage**: The project's very low cost compared to other projects in the same district could make it more attractive to voters looking for cost-effective solutions.
6. **Expected Higher Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, projects addressing common concerns like mosquito control might see an increase in votes.
7. **Project Visibility and Support**: Assuming effective communication and visible support from the city's animal sector, the project could gain additional traction among voters.

382;201;30;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Renovating Henri Russell Square: a place of life and freshness
- Cost: 250000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 5 - Saint-Michel / Saint-Agne / Empalot / Le Busca / Ile du Ramier / Monplaisir
- Description: - Reduce the presence of cars: remove car parking spaces around the square, and add bicycle parking.
- Green the square, plant trees, add a water feature, children's playgrounds, and benches.
- Review traffic along Avenue Crampel: better signal the right-of-way (or change it?), and make room for buses to turn left when exiting the square without being hindered by cars on the avenue coming from the left.
üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Such an arrangement would require the diversion of networks present on Russell Square and adapting the traffic plan.
Note that the maximum budget per project of ‚Ç¨250,000 including taxes will not allow for a complete renovation of the square.
The project would also be subject to consultation with residents and neighborhood associations. It would also require formal approval from the Architecte des B√¢timents de France.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

Before giving your answer, take time to reason thoroughly, but only explain the essential reasoning.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Renovating Henri Russell Square: a place of life and freshness, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, the district's voting behavior, and the project's cost relative to its perceived benefits. Projects that align with prevalent community needs and have a reasonable cost are more likely to receive higher votes and thus get funded.

**Analysis of ""Renovating Henri Russell Square: a place of life and freshness"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 5 has shown strong support for greening and public space projects, as seen in previous voting patterns.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is on the higher end, which might limit its chances unless it garners significant voter support.
3. **Previous Similar Projects:** Similar projects in the district and other districts have received a moderate number of votes, suggesting a consistent but not overwhelming interest.
4. **Project Appeal:** The project's focus on reducing car presence and enhancing green space aligns with current urban trends and environmental concerns, likely increasing its appeal.
5. **Competition:** With 9 projects in the district this year, competition could dilute the vote, although the project's comprehensive nature might still draw significant attention.
6. **Voter Turnout and Engagement:** An expected higher turnout could benefit well-publicized and appealing projects like this one.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of this project, it would need to rank very high to be funded, assuming no drastic changes in the total number of projects or available budget.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Renovation of the bicycle path on Claude Gonin Street and towards the Cit√© de l'espace
- Cost: 80000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 12 - Pont des Demoiselles / Ormeau / Montaudran / La Terrasse / Malep√®re
- Description: The bike lanes on Claude Gonin Street and their continuation up to the Cit√© via Carosse Way exist but need at least a fresh coat of paint to be visible, and if possible, an improvement of the surface for the comfort of bicycles as well as scooters which have smaller wheels. These bike paths connect the Cit√©, Montaudran station, the heart of Gonin neighborhood, and the LIDL shopping center. They are heavily used. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The improvement of facilities for active modes on Gonin Street is among the issues addressed by the urban studies of the metro Sequence 5. While waiting for major developments that could occur in the medium term, the maintenance of the current bike lanes (repainting) is feasible.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher engagement and voter turnout tend to perform better, as do projects addressing widely felt needs like transportation and green spaces.

**Analysis of the Project: Renovation of the Bicycle Path on Claude Gonin Street and Towards the Cit√© de l'Espace**
1. **District Voting History**: District 12 has shown strong support for similar projects, notably the Bike lane on Saint-Exup√©ry Avenue which topped the list with 492 votes.
2. **Project Theme and Relevance**: The project focuses on improving bicycle infrastructure, a theme that has historically resonated well with voters in Toulouse, aligning with ecological and mobility trends.
3. **Cost Efficiency**: At ‚Ç¨80,000, the project is moderately priced, which could allow it to be easily funded within the budget constraints, especially compared to other higher-cost projects.
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Similar projects in the same district and citywide have garnered substantial votes, suggesting a consistent voter interest in bicycle-related improvements.
5. **Expected Voter Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout and the project's alignment with popular themes, it is likely to attract a significant number of votes.
6. **Project Visibility and Urgency**: The description highlights an immediate need for maintenance, which could increase its appeal as a practical and urgent improvement.
7. **Competition Within District**: Given the project's moderate cost and high relevance, it might outperform other projects within the same district, especially those with higher costs or lower direct impact.

235;190;32;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Urban Sport for Our Youth - Installation of a Skatepark
- Cost: 200000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 18 - Lardenne / Pradettes / Basso-Cambo
- Description: La Moun√®de, a green place, the central area of our neighborhoods with convenient bus service. Our young children and teenagers need nature, to come together to create real connections, to engage in sports, to excel. This natural site, currently unused, could host a space for the youth, a project that would surely span several years, and a participatory project could be a good start. A Pumptrack and/or skate park for tomorrow, our youth need it. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Very few offerings of this type in Toulouse, especially in the West. Consideration for placement at the Ram√©e leisure base due to the risk of noise nuisance for the residents. Study for an 800 m¬≤ skate park.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, the distribution of votes across projects, and the project's cost relative to its perceived benefits. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project: Urban Sport for Our Youth - Installation of a Skatepark**
1. **District Voting History**: District 18 has shown moderate voter engagement with a project receiving up to 189 votes in the previous year, indicating a reasonable level of community participation.
2. **Project Cost**: At ‚Ç¨200,000, the skatepark is a high-cost project, which could be a double-edged sword‚Äîwhile it may attract votes due to its significant impact, it also consumes a large portion of the budget, which could affect its funding chances if there are many other popular lower-cost projects.
3. **Youth and Community Engagement**: The project targets youth and promotes sports and community engagement, which could appeal to a broad demographic, potentially increasing its vote count.
4. **Unique Offering**: The project description highlights a lack of similar facilities in the area, which could help it stand out and gather more support.
5. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in terms of theme and district have received a decent number of votes (e.g., health trail in the same park with 80 votes), suggesting a supportive environment for community and sports-related projects.
6. **Project Visibility and Appeal**: Assuming effective campaigning and visibility, the project could resonate well with the local population, especially families and sports enthusiasts.
7. **Budget Constraints and Project Ranking**: Given the total budget and the cost of the project, its success might depend heavily on the number of other high-cost projects and their popularity.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Greening and tree planting on L√©o Lagrange Street
- Cost: 250000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 5 - Saint-Michel / Saint-Agne / Empalot / Le Busca / Ile du Ramier / Monplaisir
- Description: Greening and tree planting on L√©o Lagrange Street to bring a breath of oxygen and natural coolness in summer, thus allowing for better air quality in a street that serves as a passageway and transition between neighborhoods. This will also beautify a street used by schoolchildren and high school students who are sensitive to this important issue for their future. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Due to the many networks present underground, the greening of L√©o Lagrange Street is highly constrained. Planting a line of trees along the entire length of the street would exceed the financial envelope of the participatory budget. Therefore, it is proposed to remove the asphalt from all the parking spaces on the street, with the installation of grassed cellular paving. This would recreate soil porosity without losing any parking spaces. Additionally, trees could be planted sporadically if spaces free of networks and other constraints allow it. Furthermore, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green this street. However, the agreement of each owner is mandatory to green their front facade. The owner must also commit to maintaining the pits in the long term. Moreover, this initiative will be subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and the need to maintain pedestrian continuity. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the city and metropolitan technical services, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of votes among competing projects. Projects in districts with higher average votes and those addressing popular themes like greening or infrastructure improvements tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project: Greening and Tree Planting on L√©o Lagrange Street**
1. **District Voting History**: District 5 has shown strong support for greening projects, with similar initiatives receiving substantial votes in the past (e.g., 178 votes for a development project at ‚Ç¨200,000).
2. **Project Cost**: At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is on the higher end, which might limit its feasibility under the budget cap, especially if many other projects also receive high votes.
3. **Theme Popularity**: Greening projects have historically resonated well with voters across Toulouse, suggesting a potentially high vote count.
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Similar projects in other districts with costs around ‚Ç¨200,000 received votes ranging from 95 to 178, indicating a possible range for this project.
5. **Project Description and Constraints**: The detailed and environmentally focused description may appeal to a community increasingly conscious of urban green spaces, potentially increasing voter interest.
6. **Technical and Logistical Constraints**: Mentioned constraints and the need for resident cooperation might deter some voters, considering the complexity and potential hurdles in project realization.
7. **Increased Voter Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes, but this also increases competition among the higher number of projects (183 this year).

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects.

**Analysis of the Project ""Install cooling systems for the classrooms of St Simon schools"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 14 has shown moderate voting activity with projects receiving up to 85 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of community engagement but not the highest in the city.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨215,000, this project is relatively expensive, which could be a significant factor since higher-cost projects need more votes to justify their budget allocation.
3. **Relevance and Appeal:** The project addresses a clear and relatable issue‚Äîimproving classroom conditions during heatwaves, which is likely to resonate well with voters who are parents or concerned about education and child welfare.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar ecological or comfort-related projects across the city have received a moderate number of votes, suggesting a consistent but not overwhelming interest in such themes.
5. **Historical Data from Similar District Projects:** The most voted project in this district in the previous year was a low-cost mosquito prevention initiative, which suggests that while ecological and health-related projects are supported, the voting might not scale up proportionally for higher-cost projects.
6. **Expected Increased Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes than similar projects in the past, but this will also mean more competition.
7. **Project Visibility and Advocacy:** The success of this project will heavily depend on how effectively it is promoted and advocated for within the community, especially among parents and schools.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Stop the mosquito proliferation in Montaudran
- Cost: 1000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 12 - Pont des Demoiselles / Ormeau / Montaudran / La Terrasse / Malep√®re
- Description: The proliferation of mosquitoes is a real scourge on the quality of life for us in the Toulouse neighborhood! That's why I propose experimenting with planting, in the Montaudran area: gardens along the Ligne de la Piste des G√©ants up to the park near the EHPAD, with plants that would be effective in naturally keeping this pest away. Types of plants: citronella - lavender - mint - eucalyptus, etc. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PROVIDE: It is important to note that, to date, there is no scientific consensus on the effectiveness of such plants in repelling mosquitoes. Additionally, mosquito control stations will be installed in the neighborhood as part of the previous participatory budget. Therefore, egg-laying traps could also be considered as an addition in Montaudran.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local issues, and its cost relative to the budget. Projects in districts with higher average votes or addressing pressing community concerns tend to perform better.

**Analysis of ""Stop the mosquito proliferation in Montaudran"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 12 has shown strong support for projects, especially those addressing local issues like mosquito control, as evidenced by the high votes for a similar project in the previous year.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** The project's low cost (‚Ç¨1000) makes it a highly feasible option for funding, even late in the budget allocation process.
3. **Relevance and Previous Success:** The theme of mosquito control has previously resonated well in this district, suggesting a potentially high voter interest.
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Similar projects in the district and city have received moderate to high votes, indicating a consistent interest in mosquito control solutions.
5. **Project Visibility and Scope:** Given the small scale and specific nature of the project, it might not attract as wide an audience as broader infrastructure projects but will appeal strongly to those directly affected.
6. **Potential Voter Increase:** With an expected higher turnout, projects that address common and visible issues like mosquito proliferation may see an increase in votes.
7. **Competition within District:** The project's success also depends on the nature of other competing projects within the same district, which could draw votes away if they address more pressing or popular concerns.

363;180;36;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**
1. In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Projects with higher votes get priority, but if a project's cost exceeds the remaining budget, it is skipped.
2. The voting dynamics are influenced by the project's appeal to voters, which can be affected by factors such as the project's visibility, its perceived impact, and its relevance to the community needs. District-specific voting trends and average votes per project also play a crucial role.

**Application to the Project Analysis: Greening of Fontaine Lestang Metro Station Square and Henri Desbals Street**
1. **District Voting History**: District 16 has shown moderate interest in similar greening projects, with the most related project receiving 96 votes. This suggests a baseline interest in environmental improvements.
2. **Project Cost**: At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is relatively expensive, which might limit its feasibility under the budget cap, especially if there are many other popular but less costly projects.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar greening projects across the city have received a wide range of votes, but none have broken into the top 10, indicating a moderate but not overwhelming voter interest in such projects.
4. **Project Visibility and Impact**: The project targets significant heat islands, which could increase its appeal due to the direct impact on residents' comfort and the environment.
5. **Increased Voter Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, there might be a slight increase in votes for all projects, but this also means more competition.
6. **Historical Data from Similar Projects**: Projects with similar themes and costs in other districts have not typically ranked in the top 10, suggesting a similar outcome might be expected here.
7. **Budget Constraints**: Given the high cost, if several cheaper projects rank high early on, this project might be skipped due to budget constraints despite a potentially high vote count.

345;178;37;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Extension of the greenway between Guilhermy and Lac de la Ram√©e
- Cost: 240000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 14 - Saint-Simon / Lafourguette / Oncopole-Campus Sant√© du Futur
- Description: Extend the development that allows cycling to Guilhermy College up to the Ram√©e base by reserving the currently furthest path from the small lake for pedestrians and cyclists. This could be done at a lower cost by widening the road closest to the lake between the bridge over the St Martory canal and the roundabout at the entrance to the base to make it 2 lanes for cars (the rest of the road is already wide enough). The crossing of the bridge would be done ""on sight."" WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Creation of a greenway in continuation of the existing greenway to create a junction between Guilhermy and Lake Ram√©e.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the voting history and trends within the district.

**Analysis of the Project ""Extension of the greenway between Guilhermy and Lac de la Ram√©e"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 14 has shown moderate interest in similar projects, with the highest votes around 85 for a greening project. This suggests a reasonable level of community interest in environmental enhancements.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨240,000, this project is relatively expensive, which might deter its selection unless it garners significantly high votes.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in other districts with a focus on greening and cycling paths received votes ranging from 52 to 206, indicating a varied but potentially supportive voter base for such initiatives.
4. **Project Appeal:** The project supports environmental and transportation improvements, which are popular themes. However, its high cost might require substantial voter support to justify the investment.
5. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, there might be more votes available, but also more competition among the increased number of projects.
6. **Historical Data from Similar Projects:** Projects with similar themes and costs in other districts did not break into the top 10, suggesting that while popular, the cost factor might be a significant barrier.
7. **District-Specific Trends:** The average votes for projects in District 14 were lower compared to the city's most popular projects, indicating that while the project might perform well within the district, it may struggle to compete on a city-wide scale.

- Description: Roland-Garros Square is currently a heat island in the summer, and it suffers from significant noise pollution. Moreover, it lacks green spaces and facilities for children and their parents. Our idea for our neighborhood is to redevelop Roland Garros Square into a multisport field for children aged 10 and under, and to integrate it into a wooded, friendly, demineralized, and secure environment near the kindergarten. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Depending on additional soil studies specifically on the mineral slab, the installation of a playground complementing the existing playground could be considered: multi-use structures for ages 3 to 12 (slide, climbing games, swing, and spring games with a shade cover) + installation of a fountain + plantings. The cost estimate does not account for significant pollution cleanup or diversion of networks (stormwater and others...), ‚Ç¨230,000, an additional ‚Ç¨20,000 should be planned to redo the playground in the middle.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Redevelopment of the Roland Garros dead-end for children, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, the distribution of votes across projects, and the project's cost relative to its perceived benefits. District-specific voting patterns and the average number of votes per project in each district also play crucial roles.

**Analysis of the project ""Redevelopment of the Roland Garros dead-end for children"":**
1. **District Voting Patterns:** District 8 has shown strong support for green and community-focused projects, as seen with ""Plant trees and shared gardens wherever possible!"" receiving 243 votes.
2. **Project Cost vs. Budget:** The project cost (‚Ç¨250,000) is high, which could be a limiting factor given the total budget constraint, but similar high-cost projects have been funded when they received enough votes.
3. **Theme Appeal:** The project focuses on children's play areas and green spaces, themes that have historically resonated well with voters in Toulouse, particularly in urban districts seeking more family-friendly amenities.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in other districts, like the renovation of parks or development of squares, received moderate to high votes, suggesting a generally favorable outlook for such initiatives.
5. **Historical Data from District 8:** The project ""Make Place Amat Massot... a friendly ECO-CITIZEN square!"" in the same district and with a similar cost garnered 145 votes, indicating potential for a strong showing.
6. **Visibility and Campaigning:** The success of the project will also depend on the effectiveness of its visibility and campaigning efforts to stand out among the 183 proposed projects.
7. **Expected Increase in Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, there might be a broader distribution of votes, which could affect the total votes needed to secure a top position.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Shared garden near the boules players at Croix Daurade
- Cost: 215000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 9 - Trois Cocus / Borderouge / Croix-Daurade / Pal√©ficat / Grand Selve
- Description: A plot of land has been abandoned next to the boules players' field. It is well situated for setting up a community garden as it is close to schools, the senior club, and the early childhood center. Ideal for intergenerational exchanges. It would bring freshness and conviviality and serve as an educational resource for the neighboring schools. A community compost bin would obviously find its place there. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: As part of the plan to create community gardens, the Croix Daurade neighborhood has no projects yet and we had identified it as a priority area given the proximity of facilities, schools, senior clubs, library... and a residential and collective housing conducive to diversity. However, a soil pollution study will be necessary to realize the idea.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its cost relative to the budget, and its district's voting history. Projects that resonate with a wide audience, are well-promoted, and are cost-effective tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Shared garden near the boules players at Croix Daurade"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 9 has historically shown moderate engagement, with the highest voted project receiving 111 votes in 2022. This suggests a ceiling for potential votes.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨215,000, this project is relatively expensive, which could be a disadvantage as it consumes a significant portion of the budget.
3. **Project Appeal:** The project targets a broad demographic, including schools and senior clubs, which could enhance its appeal.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects across the city have received a wide range of votes, but generally, more modestly priced projects have fared better.
5. **Historical Data from Similar Projects:** Projects in the same district with a high cost did not rank well in the previous year, suggesting that the high cost could be a limiting factor.
6. **Social and Ecological Relevance:** The project aligns with ecological and community trends, which might boost its popularity.
7. **Visibility and Promotion:** The success of the project could also hinge on how well it is promoted within the community and the broader city.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Bicycles/pedestrians/scooters cohabiting on the right bank of the Garonne Dike between Pont des Catalans and Ponts Jumeaux
- Cost: 13000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 2 - Amidonniers / Compans-Caffarelli / Brouardel
- Description: On the dyke, at certain times, the coexistence of bicycles/pedestrians/scooters is difficult. One of the challenges is the excessive speed of some bicycles. The installation of an educational radar between the Pont des Catalans and the Ponts Jumeaux, accompanied by kindly worded communication signs for all users, would serve to remind everyone of the proper behaviors for sharing this beautiful space in a peaceful manner. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: For better cohabitation of the different users of the dyke between the Pont des Catalans and the Ponts Jumeaux, it is proposed to install an educational radar to raise awareness among cyclists. Additionally, a project is being studied within the community aimed at creating new markings, installing signage and furniture (barriers at the entrance of the dyke, totem signs, logos, and rough strips). If the results prove positive, this project could be deployed on this section of the dyke.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Bicycles/pedestrians/scooters cohabiting on the right bank of the Garonne Dike between Pont des Catalans and Ponts Jumeaux, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher engagement or those addressing widely felt issues tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of the Project ""Bicycles/pedestrians/scooters cohabiting on the right bank of the Garonne Dike"":**
1. **District Voting Patterns:** The project is in District 2, which had a moderate average vote count in 2022 (58.2 votes per project). This suggests a reasonable level of engagement.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** The project cost (‚Ç¨13,000) is relatively low, making it a financially attractive option that could be easily funded within the budget constraints.
3. **Relevance and Urgency:** The project addresses a specific and relatable issue (cohabitation on a busy dike), which could resonate well with daily users of the space, potentially increasing its appeal.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects related to traffic management and pedestrian safety in the same district received moderate support, such as the noise and speed radars project which got 50 votes.
5. **Project Visibility and Scope:** The project's focus on a popular area (the dike) could enhance its visibility. However, its impact might be perceived as limited compared to broader infrastructure projects.
6. **Historical Data and Trends:** Projects with a focus on safety and cohabitation have shown varied success, but the low cost and specific focus of this project might make it more appealing than broader, more expensive projects.
7. **Expected Increase in Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, projects that are easily understandable and directly impact a significant number of residents might perform better.

390;170;41;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Installation of an orientation table on Pont Neuf to identify the Pyrenean mountains, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to a broad audience, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects. District-specific voting trends and the average number of votes per project also play a crucial role.

**Analysis of the Project ""Installation of an orientation table on Pont Neuf to identify the Pyrenean mountains"":**
1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The project's low cost (‚Ç¨8,000) compared to the total budget and other projects makes it more likely to be funded after higher-ranked, more expensive projects have been considered.
2. **District Voting Trends**: District 6 - Saint-Cyprien has shown strong support for local projects, with an average vote count significantly higher than many other districts. This suggests a relatively engaged voter base.
3. **Project Appeal**: The project has a broad appeal, enhancing the experience of both residents and tourists, which could translate into higher voter interest.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar small-scale, low-cost projects in other districts have not garnered a large number of votes, but the unique appeal of enhancing a popular tourist spot might play in its favor.
5. **Historical Data from District 6**: Previous projects in the district that were successful had a strong community or environmental focus, and while this project is less about community building, its educational and touristic value aligns with voter interests.
6. **Visibility and Accessibility**: The project's location on Pont Neuf, a prominent and frequently visited site, increases its visibility, potentially attracting more votes.
7. **Competition**: With 183 projects proposed in the current election and a higher voter turnout expected, the competition might be stiffer, affecting the project's ability to secure a top position.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Enhancement and preservation of natural spaces in Sept Deniers
- Cost: 50000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 7 - Sept Deniers / Ginestous-Sesqui√®res / Lalande
- Description: Preserve and enhance the natural spaces in the Sept Deniers by 1. protecting them (in the PLUIH) 2. naming and indicating them (signage for pedestrians and cyclists...) to make them known and accessible to everyone 3. making known the different species present in these parks (small educational panels at the foot of the trees) 4. respecting differentiated mowing to preserve biodiversity 5. preventing cars from parking there üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Differentiated mowing is applied city-wide as part of the policy for differentiated management of green spaces. Many areas are thus left with tall grasses and mowed late to respect biodiversity. Differentiated management also takes into account the challenges of usage (which must be respected and compatible with this management) and safety. In the Sept Deniers neighborhood, there are parks but also more scattered green spaces. The installation of dedicated panels to raise awareness among users about the presence of tall grasses, biodiversity, and also respect for plants and public space in general meets the needs. Cost: Graphic design involving an illustrator, manufacturing, and installation of several panels in green spaces - ‚Ç¨50,000.

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Enhancement and preservation of natural spaces in Sept Deniers"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 7 has shown moderate engagement in previous elections, with projects receiving a range of votes but generally not reaching very high numbers.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨50,000, the project is moderately priced, which could allow it to be funded after higher-cost projects have exhausted significant portions of the budget.
3. **Relevance and Appeal:** The project focuses on environmental preservation, a theme that resonates well given current global and local ecological concerns, potentially increasing its appeal.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar environmental projects across the city have received a decent number of votes, suggesting a consistent interest in green initiatives.
5. **Historical Data from Similar Projects in the District:** Previous similar projects in the district have not ranked very high, indicating potential challenges in breaking into the top ranks.
6. **Project Visibility and Understanding:** The project's success will depend significantly on how well it is communicated and understood by the voters, as its benefits are long-term and may not be immediately visible.
7. **Expected Higher Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might gain more votes if it effectively taps into the broader voter base's growing environmental consciousness.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Provide a safe crossing for pedestrians and bicycles on the bridges (exit no. 17)
- Cost: 150000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 11 - Bonhoure / Guilhem√©ry / Ch√¢teau de l'Hers / Limayrac / C√¥te Pav√©e
- Description: The crossing of the bridges over the ring road (exit no. 17) between Avenue de Castres and Balma is not safe for pedestrians and cyclists. The pedestrian crossings on both sides have high curbs on the sidewalks, making them difficult to access for people with reduced mobility. And for cyclists, there are no secure facilities. It would be interesting to redesign the pedestrian crossings and provide a bike lane to allow for the crossing of these bridges. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is interesting, especially for improving pedestrian pathways and accessibility for people with reduced mobility, but for cyclists, this will be studied within the framework of the express bike network project (REV 10), after a traffic study.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Provide a safe crossing for pedestrians and bicycles on the bridges (exit no. 17), listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of votes among competing projects within the same district or thematic area.

**Analysis of the Project ""Provide a safe crossing for pedestrians and bicycles on the bridges (exit no. 17)"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 11 has shown moderate engagement in previous elections, with projects receiving up to 103 votes. This suggests a reasonably active voting base.
2. **Project Cost and Scope:** The project cost (‚Ç¨150,000) is substantial but not excessive, fitting within the range of previously successful projects in terms of funding.
3. **Relevance and Urgency:** The project addresses safety and accessibility, which are typically high-priority issues that can motivate a significant number of votes.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar infrastructure projects related to safety and cycling have received a moderate number of votes, suggesting a consistent but not overwhelming interest in such themes.
5. **Potential Voter Base:** Given the project's focus on both pedestrian and cyclist safety, it likely appeals to a broader audience, potentially increasing its vote count.
6. **Impact of Project Description and Planning:** The detailed project description and the mention of future studies for cyclists might affect its immediate appeal, as some voters might prefer more immediate, fully planned solutions.
7. **Competition within the District:** With 10 projects in the district, competition for votes could be stiff, potentially diluting the total votes for this project.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Testing mosquito traps in the Ch√¢teau de l'Hers neighborhood
- Cost: 1000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 11 - Bonhoure / Guilhem√©ry / Ch√¢teau de l'Hers / Limayrac / C√¥te Pav√©e
- Description: Faced with the increasing number of mosquitoes in the neighborhood, I propose that the installation of mosquito traps on my street be experimented with. Traps such as ""ma bo√Æte √† moustiques"", Qista, etc., appear to be effective and are being trialed by communities. This experiment could involve willing residents of my street, and we could assess the effectiveness of these traps in conjunction with the services. This would allow the city council to decide later on whether or not to expand the use of these traps. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Principle agreement from the city‚Äôs animal sector. The type of equipment, their number, and their placement will be studied within the allotted timeframe for the realization of the idea, namely 2 years from the vote.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, with each voter allowed to vote for up to three projects. The projects are then funded in descending order of votes until the total budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to a broad or specific community need, and its cost relative to the available budget.

**Analysis of the Project: Implementation of ""Shape Detection"" Lighting in Pech David, Rangueil, and Pouvourville**

1. **District Voting History**: District 13 has shown moderate interest in similar projects, with related initiatives like the development of the Pech-David observatory site receiving 101 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of community engagement with environmental and technological enhancements.

2. **Project Cost**: At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is relatively expensive, which might limit its feasibility under the budget constraints, especially if there are many other competing projects.

3. **Project Theme and Appeal**: The project focuses on environmental sustainability and technological innovation, which are popular themes. However, its high cost and specific application (shape detection lighting) might not appeal as broadly as simpler, less expensive projects.

4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in terms of technology and environmental impact, like motion sensor lighting in the same district, received around 50 votes. This suggests a niche but consistent interest.

5. **Voter Turnout and Distribution**: With an expected higher turnout and each voter having up to three votes, the project might gain from increased overall participation but will also face more competition.

6. **Budget Constraints**: Given the total budget and the cost of this project, it's crucial to consider how many other high-cost projects are in the running, as this could influence whether it gets funded after the more popular choices.

7. **Innovative Aspect**: The innovative aspect of ""shape detection"" could attract voters interested in cutting-edge solutions, potentially increasing its vote count compared to simpler environmental projects.

Based on these considerations, here is the estimated outcome:

```json
{
  ""estimated_votes"": 110,
  ""confidence_interval"": [90, 130],
  ""expected_position"": 30,
  ""likely_in_top_5"": 0,
  ""likely_in_top_10"": 0
}
```";{'estimated_votes': 110, 'confidence_interval': [90, 130], 'expected_position': 30, 'likely_in_top_5': 0, 'likely_in_top_10': 0};206.42770980527314;30;0;0
250;159;46;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or projects addressing widespread concerns tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of the Project ""Drinking water fountain at the Place de la Charte des Libert√©s Communales"":**
1. **Cost Efficiency**: The project cost (‚Ç¨20,000) is relatively low, which is favorable as it allows for funding alongside other projects without quickly depleting the budget.
2. **District Voting History**: District 19 had a moderate average vote count in the previous election, with projects like ""Remove the asphalt from Lombez Avenue and Grande-Bretagne Avenue"" receiving up to 130 votes. This suggests a decent level of voter engagement.
3. **Project Appeal**: The project addresses a basic need (hydration) and promotes environmental consciousness by reducing plastic waste, which could appeal to a broad audience.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar utility projects in the district, like ""Public Toilets at the Jardin du Barry"" (‚Ç¨60,000), received 27 votes. Given the lower cost and potentially higher utility of the drinking fountain, it might attract more votes.
5. **Voter Turnout and Distribution**: With an expected higher turnout and 183 projects, the vote distribution might be wider. However, the project's universal appeal could help it stand out.
6. **Social and Ecological Relevance**: The project's focus on sustainability and public health aligns with contemporary urban concerns, possibly enhancing its attractiveness.
7. **Visibility and Awareness**: The project's success will partly depend on how effectively it is marketed to the electorate during the campaigning period.

271;158;47;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Tree Planting on Rue du G√©n√©ral Bourbaki
- Cost: 28000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 8 - Minimes / Barri√®re de Paris / Ponts-Jumeaux / La Vache / Raisins / Fondeyre
- Description: It would be possible to implement veganism at 96 rue du g√©n√©ral Bourbaki and 95 rue du g√©n√©ral Bourbaki. Several trees (3-4) could be planted without hindering vehicle parking and while bringing some freshness and shade in the summer. Similarly, tree plantings can be made between 119 and 110 Rue du G√©n√©ral Bourbaki. A large strip of land already has some trees/shrubs, but a real small forest could be established and enhance the neighborhood. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Possible planting of four trees on the roadway near 95 rue du G√©n√©ral Bourbaki, with roadwork to be planned (creation of pits on sidewalks and possible diversion of networks). The spaces in front of 96 and 119 rue du G√©n√©ral Bourbaki are private properties on which the community cannot intervene.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Tree Planting on Rue du G√©n√©ral Bourbaki, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher average votes and those addressing popular themes like environmental sustainability tend to perform better.

**Analysis of Tree Planting on Rue du G√©n√©ral Bourbaki:**
1. **District Voting History:** District 8 has shown strong support for green projects, as evidenced by the high votes for similar projects in the past.
2. **Project Theme and Appeal:** The project focuses on environmental enhancement, a popular theme, especially in urban areas seeking green spaces.
3. **Cost Efficiency:** At ‚Ç¨28,000, the project is moderately priced, which could allow it to be funded after higher-cost projects are considered, assuming similar budget constraints as in 2022.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** A similar project in the same district (""Plant trees and shared gardens wherever possible!"") received 243 votes and ranked 5th, suggesting a strong voter base for this type of initiative.
5. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, projects that resonate well with community values, like tree planting, might see a proportional increase in votes.
6. **Project Specifics and Location:** The project's detailed plan for enhancing specific locations with trees could appeal to local residents familiar with the areas, boosting its votes.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it is likely affordable within the budget after funding several higher-cost projects.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Intersection of Boulevard d'Arcole and Rue de la Concorde
- Cost: 35000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
- Description: üí°¬†THE IDEA EXPRESSED BY @PMaze: The crossing in front of Decathlon is not safe for bicycles coming down Rue de la Concorde and joining Jeanne d'Arc via either Boulevard or Rue de Merly opposite. One must use the pedestrian crossing or cross a white line. Moreover, it involves cycling against the direction on Concorde, moving to the left side so as not to hinder cars merging onto the service road or buses. Redesign of traffic lights, creation of a bicycle crossingüîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A redesign of the intersection with road markings that include a dedicated space for cyclists can be implemented. Additionally, traffic lights for bicycles can be installed at various intersections, as well as a bicycle box for cyclists going from Place Jeanne d'Arc to Rue de la Concorde via the service road. This box will be located on the service road at the corner of Rue de la Concorde.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Securing pedestrians and cyclists at the corner of Henri Bessemer Road and Chemin du Sang de Serp
- Cost: 100000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 8 - Minimes / Barri√®re de Paris / Ponts-Jumeaux / La Vache / Raisins / Fondeyre
- Description: At the intersection of Bessemer Road and Sang de Serp Road, there is no secure pedestrian crossing. Traffic is increasingly heavy on Sang de Serp Road and through the small adjacent streets (notably Bessemer Road) as drivers try to avoid the congested main roads. It has become very difficult and especially very dangerous to cross when one is a pedestrian or cyclist. Beyond proposing security measures, I am raising the alarm about the danger of this location for pedestrians and cyclists. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Possible security enhancement on a raised platform.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of votes among competing projects. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project: Securing Pedestrians and Cyclists at the Corner of Henri Bessemer Road and Chemin du Sang de Serp**

1. **District Voting History**: District 8 has shown strong support for community and safety projects, as evidenced by previous voting patterns. Projects like ""Plant trees and shared gardens wherever possible!"" received substantial votes, indicating a community interest in safety and environmental enhancements.

2. **Project Theme and Relevance**: The project addresses a clear and present need for safety improvements at a busy intersection, which is a concern likely shared by many residents, potentially increasing its appeal.

3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects, especially those focusing on pedestrian and cyclist safety, have received moderate to high votes in the past. For instance, projects enhancing bike lanes and pedestrian paths in other districts have ranked well.

4. **Cost vs. Budget Impact**: With a cost of ‚Ç¨100,000, the project is moderately priced, which allows for a good balance between substantial impact and budget feasibility, making it more likely to be funded within the available budget constraints.

5. **Expected Voter Turnout and Engagement**: With an expected higher turnout and 183 projects competing, the project needs to stand out significantly to gather enough votes. Increased competition might dilute the vote across more projects.

6. **Project Visibility and Advocacy**: The success of the project could also hinge on how well it is promoted and the extent of advocacy by local residents and groups, which is not quantifiable but crucial.

7. **Historical Data and Statistical Analysis**: Based on the average votes and distribution from the previous year, and considering the project's relevance and moderate cost, it is likely to perform better than average but may not reach the very top due to the increased number of competing projects.

8. **Strategic Positioning**: Located in a district with previously successful similar projects, it might gain traction among voters who have seen the benefits of similar past projects.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Secure the bike passage between Rue de Metz and Pont Neuf
- Cost: 2000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 1 - Capitole / Arnaud Bernard / Carmes
- Description: The new bike lane created on Rue de Metz finally allows for bike traffic on dedicated paths. One very dangerous point remains at the end of Rue de Metz, to cross Quai de Tounis towards Pont Neuf. Bikes coming from Rue de Metz cannot see cars turning left into Quai de Tounis from the same street. A separate bike traffic light, offset from the car lights, would be necessary for safe crossing for all users. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal as formulated cannot be accepted. Indeed, by regulation, the bike crossing is managed by the pedestrian light. As with all intersections with traffic lights, when the pedestrian light is green, vehicles in the left-turn lane also have a green light and must be vigilant for crossing bikes and pedestrians. Moreover, a three-color bike traffic light cannot be installed because this equipment requires a phase during which the bike light is on. This is not feasible due to the significant impact on traffic on Rue de Metz. However, an experiment can be set up on this pedestrian light with the installation of a bike crossing box: this will allow for a better understanding of the intersection by cyclists.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

291;152;51;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Jean Jaur√®s Composting Site
- Cost: 7000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
- Description: Establishment of a composting site on the Jean Jaur√®s ramblas in the middle and sheltered by the already existing vegetation (to avoid direct sunlight). The city hall could also use this compost as fertilizer for all the surrounding plants... But also collect the ""brown"" from the vegetation of these ramblas for composting. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Such an installation in this area can be studied. However, the conditions for technical feasibility do not seem optimal (hard soil, complex accessibility...). Finally, as with any collective composting site, a sufficient number of people committing to manage it will be necessary.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher engagement or those addressing widely felt issues tend to perform better.

**Analysis of Jean Jaur√®s Composting Site:**
1. **Cost Efficiency**: The project's low cost (‚Ç¨7,000) makes it a financially attractive option, allowing it to be funded even late in the allocation process without significantly impacting the remaining budget.
2. **District Voting History**: District 3 had a moderate average vote count in 2022, with projects like ""Greening and conviviality of the Saint-Aubin neighborhood"" receiving 94 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of engagement with environmental initiatives.
3. **Project Theme**: Environmental and greening projects have shown moderate popularity across the city, aligning with a growing public interest in sustainability.
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Similar low-cost projects like ""Shared Compost 'lalala'land"" received 61 votes, indicating a baseline interest in composting initiatives.
5. **Technical Challenges**: The project description notes potential technical and participation challenges, which might deter some voters.
6. **Increased Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, the project might benefit from more votes overall, but also faces more competition.
7. **Visibility and Promotion**: The project's success will heavily depend on how well it is promoted and its perceived benefits to the community.

395;145;52;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Creation of a street art work in the neighborhood, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects. District-specific voting trends and historical data on similar projects also play a crucial role in predicting outcomes.

**Analysis of the Project ""Creation of a street art work in the neighborhood"":**
1. **District Voting Trends:** District 5 has shown strong support for community and environmental projects, with an average vote count higher than many other districts.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** The project cost (‚Ç¨25,000) is relatively low, which could allow it to be easily funded within the available budget, increasing its chances of selection.
3. **Theme Relevance:** The project's focus on ecology and community beautification aligns with popular themes in previous elections, potentially attracting more votes.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in the same district, like ""Brushstroke on the neighborhood's concrete"" (‚Ç¨50,000, 56 votes), suggest a moderate level of interest in art-related initiatives.
5. **Expected Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout and the project's moderate appeal, it is likely to receive a decent number of votes but may not be among the top contenders.
6. **Historical Data:** Projects in District 5 with costs around ‚Ç¨20,000-‚Ç¨50,000 received between 50 to 128 votes in the previous election, suggesting a possible range for this project.
7. **Project Visibility and Engagement:** The project's success will also depend on how effectively it is marketed and the community's engagement with the planning process.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Greening the front of Toulouse Lautrec Middle School
- Cost: 60000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 8 - Minimes / Barri√®re de Paris / Ponts-Jumeaux / La Vache / Raisins / Fondeyre
- Description: Ga√´lle: The entrance to the school consists of a few trees. Our idea is to make full use of the space, making it welcoming and friendly for both students and local residents:
- add some trees
- create flower beds and aromatic plant areas
- provide some benches
- install bicycle racks
- offer a dog waste bag dispenser.
This will help provide shade and coolness! üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It is possible to green this space on the northern part, with access for fire trucks and large vehicles on the southern part. The project would be to increase the number of trees by adding seven new ones on the sandy esplanade by creating new planting areas surrounded by low walls/seats and to create a slab with bicycle arches. No low-growing aromatic plants, only ground-cover plants at the base of the trees, due to recurring damage.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of votes across various projects. Projects in districts with higher average votes and those addressing popular themes like greening and community spaces tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project: Greening the front of Toulouse Lautrec Middle School**

1. **District Voting History**: District 8 has shown strong support for greening and community-friendly projects, as evidenced by high votes for similar projects in the past.
2. **Project Theme and Appeal**: The project focuses on greening and enhancing community space, which aligns well with previously successful themes in the district and citywide.
3. **Cost-Effectiveness**: At ‚Ç¨60,000, the project is moderately priced, which may appeal to voters looking for impactful yet financially reasonable projects.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar greening projects have received a decent number of votes, suggesting a consistent interest in such initiatives among voters.
5. **Increased Voter Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, projects that resonate well with community values, like this one, might receive more votes.
6. **Project Visibility and Utility**: The project's location at a middle school may increase its visibility and perceived utility, garnering support from both parents and local residents.
7. **Historical Data from Similar Projects**: Analyzing similar projects from the previous year, projects with a focus on greening in similar budget ranges received votes that would rank them around the middle of the list, suggesting a competitive but not top-tier position for this project.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Development of the Twin Bridges leisure base, creation of autonomous toilets
- Cost: 70000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 7 - Sept Deniers / Ginestous-Sesqui√®res / Lalande
- Description: The Twin Bridges Park is very popular for its basketball, soccer, and other sports fields, but there are no toilets or water points for hydration during physical activity (except for a small, inconspicuous tap at the tennis courts). Several water points should be created in the park. The accessibility for people with reduced mobility in the park also needs to be reviewed. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A water fountain will be installed in May 2024 (on Jean Gayral Street side), and the request for toilet installation has been approved; these will be autonomous toilets, and a specific location will need to be studied.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing widespread issues tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Development of the Twin Bridges leisure base, creation of autonomous toilets"":**
1. **District Voting History:** The district of Sept Deniers / Ginestous-Sesqui√®res / Lalande has shown moderate voting activity, with projects receiving an average of around 30 to 60 votes.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** The project cost (‚Ç¨70,000) is moderate and more feasible within the budget constraints compared to higher-cost projects, making it a potentially attractive option for funding.
3. **Community Need and Relevance:** The project addresses a clear need for amenities in a popular park, which could appeal to a broad segment of the district's population, potentially increasing its vote count.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in the district and city have received modest vote counts, suggesting a tempered but present interest in such amenities.
5. **Project Visibility and Appeal:** The project's focus on essential amenities like toilets and water points is less glamorous but highly practical, which might not drive high enthusiasm but ensures steady support.
6. **Historical Data from Similar Projects:** Projects with similar themes and costs in other districts have generally not ranked in the top 10, indicating a possible challenge in breaking into the top ranks.
7. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes than similar past projects, but this will also increase competition.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to a wide audience, and its cost-effectiveness. Projects that address widespread concerns or offer tangible benefits to a large number of residents tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the project ""Mosquito control actions in district 15"":**
1. **Theme Relevance and Previous Success**: Mosquito control projects have historically garnered significant voter interest, as evidenced by similar projects in other districts receiving a substantial number of votes.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: With a low cost of ‚Ç¨1000, this project is highly cost-effective, allowing for potentially higher ranking since it uses a minimal portion of the budget.

Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to a broad demographic, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing widespread issues like transportation and green spaces tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the project ""Redevelopment of the park at rue Fonquerne / rue Jean Nico"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 8 has shown strong support for green and community space projects, as seen with ""Plant trees and shared gardens wherever possible!"" receiving 243 votes.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is relatively expensive, which might limit its ability to be funded unless it garners significant voter support.
3. **Project Theme:** The focus on greening and improving community spaces aligns with previously successful projects, suggesting potential popularity.
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Similar projects in terms of theme and district have received a moderate number of votes (e.g., ""Make Place Amat Massot..."" with 145 votes).
5. **Complexity and Consultation Needs:** The project involves complex changes like traffic rerouting, which might require more consultation and could affect voter perception.
6. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it needs substantial votes to be considered for funding, especially as it competes against 182 other projects.
7. **Expected Voter Turnout Increase:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes, but this also increases competition.

Before giving your answer, take time to reason thoroughly, but only explain the essential reasoning.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project City park for the young people of Ancely / Roman Arenas, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing more pressing community needs tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of the Project ""City park for the young people of Ancely / Roman Arenas"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 20 had a moderate voting turnout in the previous election, with the most popular project receiving 164 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of engagement.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨100,000, the project's cost is moderate and feasible within the budget constraints, making it more likely to be funded if it garners enough votes.
3. **Community Need and Appeal:** The project addresses the needs of young people, a demographic likely to mobilize for amenities that directly benefit them, potentially increasing voter support.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in terms of theme and district have received a moderate number of votes (e.g., Multi-Activity Terrain near the Touch with 49 votes).
5. **Increased Turnout Expectation:** With an expected higher turnout, there might be a proportional increase in votes for all projects, but particularly those appealing to a broad demographic.
6. **Project Visibility and Support:** If the project is well-publicized and advocated for by local community groups, it could see higher voting numbers.
7. **Budget Allocation Dynamics:** Given the project's cost and the total budget, it stands a good chance of being funded if it ranks within the top projects by votes.

  ""estimated_votes"": 70,

247;137;58;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Planting of fruit trees and/or berry bushes - Jos√©phine Baker Alley, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects. Projects in districts with historically higher engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Planting of fruit trees and/or berry bushes - Jos√©phine Baker Alley"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 19 has shown moderate engagement, with the highest voted project receiving 130 votes in 2022. This suggests a reasonable level of voter participation but not the highest in the city.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨150,000, the project is moderately expensive, which could affect its funding chances if there are many other popular but less expensive projects.
3. **Project Theme:** Environmental and greening projects have shown popularity across the city, as seen with similar projects in other districts. This thematic appeal could boost voter interest.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects in other districts have received a decent number of votes (e.g., 243 votes for a ‚Ç¨20,000 project in District 8), suggesting a favorable outlook for this type of project.
5. **Previous Similar Project in the Same District:** A similar project, ""Jos√©phine Baker Walkway Development"" at a higher cost (‚Ç¨200,000), received 39 votes. This project being less expensive might attract more votes.
6. **Overall Competition:** With 183 projects proposed in the upcoming election and a higher voter turnout expected, the competition will be intense, possibly diluting the vote across many projects.
7. **Project Visibility and Appeal:** Assuming effective campaigning and the project's appeal due to its environmental focus, it could perform better than similar past projects in the same district.

324;132;59;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Tree planting on the parking lot on Rue des Fontaines, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects. Projects in districts with higher average votes and those addressing popular themes like environmental sustainability tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Tree planting on the parking lot on Rue des Fontaines"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 19 had a moderate average vote count in the previous election, with projects receiving between 35 to 130 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of voter engagement.
2. **Project Theme:** The project aligns with popular themes of environmental sustainability and urban cooling, which have historically attracted a good number of votes.
3. **Cost Comparison:** At ‚Ç¨100,000, the project's cost is moderate and similar to other projects in the district that received decent support, such as ""Limit the lighting of the equipment - Cartoucherie-Zenith.""
4. **Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects across the city have received a wide range of votes, but generally, projects under ‚Ç¨100,000 or slightly above tend to perform better.
5. **Project Specifics and Challenges:** The project involves significant changes like de-impermeabilization, which might be seen as ambitious but could also face logistical concerns due to the narrow street and tall buildings, possibly affecting voter perception.
6. **Competition Within District:** With 9 projects submitted in the district this year, competition is slightly lower than average, which might benefit the project.
7. **Expected Higher Turnout:** A higher turnout could increase the total votes cast, potentially diluting the impact of highly committed voter groups unless the project can appeal broadly.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Improvement of Parc de la Vache: Planting of trees and installation of additional tables and benches
- Cost: 80000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 8 - Minimes / Barri√®re de Paris / Ponts-Jumeaux / La Vache / Raisins / Fondeyre
- Description: Renovation of play areas, more greenery as well as additional tables and chairs. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The playground is in good condition. The ground was redone 2 years ago. The installation of additional benches and picnic tables could enhance the conviviality of this green space. Additional plantings would reinforce the greening and shading of the site. The proposal would therefore be to install 15 additional benches + 5 picnic tables adapted for people with reduced mobility and to plant about fifty trees to reinforce the existing alignments along the paths.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**
1. In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the total budget.
2. Projects that address widespread concerns or enhance communal spaces tend to gather more votes. The district's voting history and the average number of votes per project also play crucial roles in determining a project's success.

**Application of Framework to the Project ""Improvement of Parc de la Vache""**
1. **District Voting History**: District 8 has shown strong support for greening and communal space projects, as evidenced by high votes for similar projects in the past.
2. **Project Theme and Appeal**: The project focuses on enhancing a park, a theme that has historically resonated well with voters in this district, suggesting a potentially high voter turnout.
3. **Cost Analysis**: At ‚Ç¨80,000, the project's cost is moderate and feasible within the budget constraints, compared to other successful projects in the same district.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in the district, like ""Plant trees and shared gardens wherever possible!"" and ""Make Place Amat Massot... a friendly ECO-CITIZEN square!"", received substantial votes, indicating a favorable reception for this type of initiative.
5. **Expected Voter Turnout and Project Visibility**: With an expected higher turnout and the project's relevance to community enhancement, it is likely to attract significant attention and votes.
6. **Statistical Consideration**: Given the average and range of votes for similar projects, a realistic estimation of votes can be made, considering both the project's appeal and the competitive landscape of other projects in the district.
7. **Budget Allocation Strategy**: The cost of the project allows for a strategic allocation of the budget, potentially enabling it to be funded after higher-voted but more expensive projects are considered.

269;128;63;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Soothe and greenify Rue de la Dalbade
- Cost: 75000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 1 - Capitole / Arnaud Bernard / Carmes
- Description: Hello, La rue de la Dalbade is very mineral-like, and the surroundings of the school are very dangerous because vehicles do not respect the speed limits on this street. By redesigning the front of the school with shrubs and a raised crossing, it would be possible to reduce vehicle speeds and calm this area. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Since January 2023, the Fabre nursery school has benefited from the 'school street' scheme on rue Saint-Jean. This scheme reduces traffic during school entry and exit times in front of the nursery school. An evaluation of the scheme is planned very soon with the parents of students and local residents. Depending on the feedback, additional modifications could be made. Regarding the security issues on rue de la Dalbade and around Fabre elementary school, a speed bump is already in place, and speed measurements are low. However, in addition to the existing speed bump, the deployment of a speed reduction scheme on the street can be proposed. The road markings could also be revised, particularly for pedestrian crossings near the school. A parking space will also be removed at the corner of Dalbade and St Jean for better visibility of the pedestrian crossing. Concerning the very mineral aspect of rue de la Dalbade, it can be proposed to ""green"" Pierre Bruni√®re street (type of project with stemmed shrubs) where the sidewalk is wider than that of rue de la Dalbade (subject to the approval of the Architecte des B√¢timents de France and the absence of networks). Indeed, rue de la Dalbade is long, and such an arrangement is not compatible with the deadlines and budget associated with this participatory budget.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of votes among competing projects within the same district or thematic area.

**Analysis of the Project ""Soothe and greenify Rue de la Dalbade""**

1. **District Voting Trends**: The project is located in District 1, which historically shows strong voter engagement and support for greening and pedestrian safety projects, as evidenced by high votes for similar projects in the previous year.
   
2. **Project Theme and Relevance**: The project focuses on safety and greening, themes that resonate well with the community, especially in urban settings where such enhancements are highly valued.
   
3. **Cost-Effectiveness**: At ‚Ç¨75,000, the project is moderately priced, which could make it more appealing compared to higher-cost projects, potentially allowing it to secure funding within the available budget.
   
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in the same district, like the greening of Place du Capitole and dedicated bike paths, received substantial votes, suggesting a favorable reception for this type of initiative.
   
5. **Safety and Environmental Impact**: The project addresses both safety concerns and environmental enhancement, aligning with broader civic priorities which could drive higher voter turnout and support.
   
6. **Project Visibility and Impact**: The project's focus on a specific and busy area (Rue de la Dalbade) might attract votes from residents who experience the issues firsthand, thereby increasing its visibility and perceived impact.
   
7. **Historical Data and Project Ranking**: Analyzing past data, projects under ‚Ç¨100,000 in this district have performed variably, but greening projects have generally fared well, suggesting a potential top 10 finish but less certainty about reaching the top 5.

346;127;64;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Toulouse's Participatory Budgeting**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, who can vote for up to three projects. The total budget is allocated using a greedy algorithm, funding projects in descending order of votes until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, cost, and alignment with community needs and preferences.

**Application of Framework to the Project: Rehabilitation of the Barry Garden boulodrome**

1. **District Voting History**: District 19 has shown moderate voting activity with projects like the asphalt removal receiving 130 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of community engagement.
   
2. **Project Cost and Appeal**: The project cost (‚Ç¨100,000) is moderate and aligns with costs of previously successful projects in the district. The project's community and recreational focus (rehabilitation for p√©tanque enthusiasts) is likely to have broad appeal.

3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in terms of cost and theme, such as the sports complex in District 10 and the boulodrome in District 18, received between 189 and 205 votes, indicating good potential for this project.

4. **District's Average Votes**: The average votes for projects in District 19 were around 49.8, but more engaging projects significantly exceeded this average.

5. **Project Uniqueness and Need**: The project completes the renovation of a local garden, adding to its uniqueness and perceived need, which could drive higher voter turnout and support.

6. **Economic and Social Context**: Given the project's contribution to community sports and outdoor activities, it aligns well with broader social interests in health and community bonding, potentially increasing its appeal.

7. **Visibility and Campaign**: Assuming effective promotion within the community, the project could see higher engagement compared to the district's average.

Based on these points, here are the estimated outcomes:

```json

  ""estimated_votes"": 160,
  ""confidence_interval"": [140, 180],
  ""expected_position"": 15,

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**
1. In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget cap is reached. 
2. The voting dynamics are influenced by the project's appeal, visibility, and relevance to the community, as well as the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits. District-specific factors and historical voting patterns also play a crucial role in determining the number of votes a project might receive.

**Analysis of the Project ""Greening of Emile Male Square""**
1. **District Voting History**: District 16 has shown moderate interest in similar projects, with a project of similar theme and higher cost receiving 96 votes in the previous year.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: At ‚Ç¨45,000, the project is relatively affordable compared to other greening projects, which could make it more appealing to voters concerned about budget efficiency.
3. **Theme Popularity**: Greening projects have been moderately popular across Toulouse, and the specific focus on combating heat could resonate well given increasing awareness of climate issues.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in the same district have garnered up to 96 votes, suggesting a baseline of interest that this project might also achieve or exceed.
5. **Project Visibility and Scope**: The project's focus on a specific square might limit its appeal compared to more extensive projects, but its practical benefits for market days could attract local voter support.
6. **Budget Constraints**: With a total budget of ‚Ç¨8,000,000 and the project's lower relative cost, it is likely to be funded if it receives enough votes to rank reasonably high.
7. **Expected Increase in Voter Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, the project might benefit from increased participation, although this could also mean higher competition.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Underground safety in Montaudran for pedestrians and cyclists
- Cost: 10000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 12 - Pont des Demoiselles / Ormeau / Montaudran / La Terrasse / Malep√®re
- Description: The underground area of Montaudran station is shared between bicycles and pedestrians, but without any demarcation of spaces. The turn between the two ramps of the underpass is dangerous because pedestrians and bicycles cannot see each other. It would be necessary to demarcate a bicycle lane along the underpass and install a mirror at the curve just before the stairs. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The installation of a mirror is not permissible under current regulations, however, given the increase in pedestrian traffic linked to the metro and the busy days at the Halle des Machines, the demarcation of a bicycle lane should be considered, provided there is enough width to create both a sidewalk and a bicycle path (a total minimum of 4.5m), as well as encouraging able-bodied pedestrians to use the stairs to avoid conflicts of use.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Underground safety in Montaudran for pedestrians and cyclists, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, relevance to community needs, and cost-effectiveness. Projects in districts with historically higher engagement or those addressing widespread concerns tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Underground safety in Montaudran for pedestrians and cyclists"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 12 has shown strong support for infrastructure projects, especially those enhancing safety and mobility, as evidenced by the high votes for the bike lane on Saint-Exup√©ry Avenue.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** The project's relatively low cost (‚Ç¨10,000) makes it a financially attractive option, likely allowing it to be funded even after higher-cost projects have been considered.
3. **Relevance and Urgency:** The project addresses a clear safety concern, which is a compelling factor for voters, especially in an area increasing in pedestrian and cyclist traffic.
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Similar projects with a focus on cycling and pedestrian safety have received moderate to high support, such as the creation of dedicated paths in District 1.
5. **Project Visibility and Scope:** The project's scope, while significant for safety, is relatively small and localized, which might limit its appeal compared to more expansive or visually impactful projects.
6. **Voter Turnout and Engagement:** An expected higher turnout could increase competition among projects, but also means a potentially larger absolute number of supporters if the project resonates well.
7. **Historical Data from Similar Projects:** Projects with similar themes in the district have ranked well, suggesting a good baseline of support for this type of initiative.

359;123;68;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Securing the bike lane on Henri Desbals Street
- Cost: 110000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 16 - Fontaine-Lestang / Ar√®nes / Bagatelle / Papus / Tabar / Bordelongue / Mermoz / La Faourette
- Description: The one-way system has reduced the number of vehicles using the road. However, cars still drive too fast, some even use the bike lane for overtaking or parking. Therefore, it is necessary to secure this street with bollards between the two lanes (bike and car) and consider installing speed bumps. The current red speed bumps are useless. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of extruded curbs to separate the bike lane from the roadway. Visual reinforcement of the layout with a colored coating and installation of speed cushions.

2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨110,000, the project is moderately expensive, which means it could potentially be funded after several higher-ranked, less expensive projects are considered.
3. **Previous Similar Projects:** Similar projects related to bike safety and infrastructure have received a moderate number of votes, suggesting a consistent but not overwhelming interest in such initiatives.
4. **Project Relevance:** The project addresses safety, a concern likely shared by many, potentially increasing its appeal.
5. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** A previous project on the same street for a bike path received 66 votes. Given this project's focus on safety, it might attract slightly more interest.
6. **Voter Turnout and Distribution:** With an expected higher turnout and 183 projects competing, the vote distribution might be wider, possibly affecting the total votes this project could garner.
7. **Budget Constraints:** The total budget and the cost of competing projects will influence whether this project gets funded after the top vote-getters are considered.

357;121;69;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Redevelop the greenway between Fontaine Lestang Park and the Ar√®nes, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher engagement and average votes tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Redevelop the greenway between Fontaine Lestang Park and the Ar√®nes"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 16 has shown moderate engagement in past elections, with projects receiving a range of votes but generally not reaching the top ranks.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨225,000, this project is relatively expensive, which could limit its funding chances if cheaper projects gather more votes.
3. **Project Theme:** The focus on greening and improving public spaces aligns with popular themes in other districts, suggesting potential voter interest.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in other districts have received a decent number of votes, but none have been top-ranked, indicating a mid-tier popularity for such themes.
5. **Historical Data from Similar Projects in the District:** The most similar project in terms of theme and district (""Planting vegetation to limit summer overheating..."") received 96 votes, suggesting a possible voting range.
6. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes than similar past projects, but this also increases competition.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it's crucial how other projects perform; a few very popular lower-cost projects could diminish its chances of being funded.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Promoting cool islands in Lardenne through greening, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher engagement and lower competition tend to perform better.

**Analysis of ""Promoting cool islands in Lardenne through greening"":**
1. **High Cost**: At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is among the more expensive ones, which could limit its funding chances if the budget runs tight.
2. **District Voting History**: District 18 had a relatively high voter turnout and support for greening projects in the past, suggesting a good base level of interest.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar greening projects across the city have received moderate to high votes, indicating a general popularity of such themes.
4. **Previous District Projects**: The most voted project in this district in the last election was also costly (‚Ç¨200,000) and received 189 votes, suggesting that high-cost projects can still perform well here.
5. **Voter Engagement and Project Count**: With an increased number of projects (183 this year) and possibly higher voter turnout, competition for votes might be stiffer.
6. **Theme Relevance**: The project's focus on ecological improvement aligns with current global and local trends towards sustainability, potentially increasing its appeal.
7. **Budget Constraints**: Given the total budget and the cost of this project, it's crucial that it secures a high number of votes to be considered for funding.

3. **Community Need:** The project addresses a clear community need, which is the lack of public toilets, especially noted during the market days when existing facilities are closed.
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Similar projects in other districts have not garnered high votes, suggesting that while the need is recognized, it might not be the highest priority for voters.
5. **Project Type and Appeal:** Infrastructure projects, especially those improving basic amenities like toilets, can have a broad appeal, although they might not be as exciting or innovative as others.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Greening Lauragais Avenue
- Cost: 100000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 13 - Rangueil / Sauzelong / Jules-Julien / Pech-David / Pouvourville
- Description: From 48 to 106 Lauragais Avenue (railway) there is a wide road, thus the possibility of planting trees on at least one side to cool down this heat island (street). The cables would need to be buried first. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is acceptable provided that the congestion of the underground can be verified, which is currently underway. In the short term, it is possible to plant trees by removing some parking spaces.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Greening Lauragais Avenue, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widespread concerns tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Greening Lauragais Avenue"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 13 had a moderate average vote count in 2022, with projects like ""Fruit tree plantations"" and ""Development of the Pech-David observatory site"" receiving 116 and 101 votes respectively. This suggests a reasonable level of voter engagement for greening projects in this district.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨100,000, the cost of this project is moderate and similar to other projects in the district that have historically received a good number of votes.
3. **Project Theme:** Greening projects have been popular across Toulouse, as seen in the 2022 data. This thematic appeal should help the project attract votes.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects in other districts received votes ranging from 76 to 116, indicating a potential for moderate to high voter interest.
5. **Project Visibility and Impact:** The project involves a significant visual change by adding greenery to a wide road, which could increase its appeal to residents who frequent the area.
6. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of this project, it is feasible to fund this project if it ranks high enough in votes.
7. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, there might be more votes cast overall, which could affect the distribution of votes across projects but also potentially increase the total votes this project might receive.

270;117;73;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Installation of wooden planters at the Claude Nougaro metro station
- Cost: 35000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 8 - Minimes / Barri√®re de Paris / Ponts-Jumeaux / La Vache / Raisins / Fondeyre
- Description: A row of hackberry trees cools the Minimes Avenue. However, due to the metro access construction, this row has been interrupted over a significant length. As a result, it gets very hot there in the summer. My idea would be to restore the alignment and place a shade structure where it's not possible (the restaurant terraces would be more attractive). It would also be a good opportunity to regulate the trash bins, as this area is overrun with them all day Sunday. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Planting trees is impossible over a metro corridor. There is a possibility to be validated by Tiss√©o, using artificial planters without the possibility of connecting to the natural ground is feasible (about 15 m long).

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widespread concerns tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of the Project ""Installation of wooden planters at the Claude Nougaro metro station"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 8 has shown strong support for greening and community enhancement projects, as evidenced by high votes for similar initiatives in the past.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨35,000, the project is moderately priced, which may allow it to be funded even after higher-cost projects, assuming similar voting patterns and budget allocations as previous years.
3. **Project Appeal:** The project addresses a practical need for shade and aesthetic improvement in a busy area, likely resonating well with local residents and commuters.
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Similar greening projects in the district have garnered substantial support, such as ""Plant trees and shared gardens wherever possible!"" with 243 votes.
5. **Voter Turnout and Engagement:** With an expected higher turnout and 10 projects competing in the district, the project needs to stand out to capture sufficient votes.
6. **Project Visibility and Awareness:** The success of the project will also depend on the campaigning efforts and visibility among voters.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of competing projects, this project's moderate cost may allow it to be funded after more expensive projects have been considered.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Mosquito trap in Lardenne, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing widespread issues tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the project ""Mosquito trap in Lardenne"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 18 has shown moderate voting activity with projects like ""Land covered at the level of the boulodrome"" receiving significant support (189 votes). However, the average project vote in this district is around 62.2, indicating a moderately engaged voter base.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** The project cost (‚Ç¨10,000) is relatively low, which could allow it to be easily funded within the remaining budget after higher-cost projects are considered.
3. **Project Theme Relevance:** Mosquito control has been a recurring theme, with similar projects across the city receiving a decent number of votes (e.g., 258 votes in District 12). This suggests a general voter interest in mosquito control initiatives.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** A similar project in the same district (""Stop the mosquitoes! Let's switch to traps!"") received 67 votes. Given the slightly higher cost of the new project, a similar or slightly higher interest can be expected.
5. **Expected Voter Turnout Increase:** With an expected higher turnout, projects might receive a proportional increase in votes, benefiting those with themes of broad interest.
6. **Project Visibility and Promotion:** Assuming effective communication and relevance to local issues, the project could perform well, especially if promoted as a health and community welfare initiative.
7. **Greedy Algorithm Impact:** Due to its lower cost, this project has a higher chance of being funded after more expensive projects are considered, assuming it garners enough votes to be competitive.

  ""estimated_votes"": 75,

229;116;75;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the budget. Projects in districts with higher engagement or pressing issues tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of ""Stop mosquitoes, let's switch to traps in the Lalande district"":**
1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The project's low cost (‚Ç¨1000) makes it highly feasible within the budget constraints, allowing it to be easily funded even if it doesn't top the vote count.
2. **District Voting History**: District 7 had moderate voter engagement in 2022, with the highest-voted project receiving 61 votes. This suggests a mid-range popularity for projects in this area.
3. **Project Theme Relevance**: Mosquito control has been a popular theme across Toulouse, with similar projects receiving a decent number of votes, indicating a general public interest in this issue.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar mosquito control projects in other districts have garnered between 49 to 258 votes, suggesting a potential for moderate to high interest.
5. **Project Visibility and Urgency**: The specific focus on tiger mosquitoes, which are a public health concern, could increase the project's visibility and perceived urgency, potentially boosting voter interest.
6. **Historical Data from Similar Projects**: Projects with a similar theme and cost in other districts ranked from 4th to 81st, indicating variability based on district-specific factors.
7. **Expected Voter Turnout Increase**: With an expected higher turnout in the upcoming election, projects might receive generally higher votes, but competition will also increase.

1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Greening the bases of the lime trees on Avenue de Muret, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of votes among competing projects within the same district or thematic area.

**Analysis of the Project ""Greening the bases of the lime trees on Avenue de Muret"":**
1. **District Voting History:** The district of Croix de Pierre / Route d'Espagne has shown moderate interest in similar greening projects, with a previous similar project receiving 79 votes.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is relatively expensive, which might deter some voters given the limited budget and high competition among projects.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects across the city have received a range of votes, generally not exceeding 100 votes, indicating a moderate level of popularity for such initiatives.
4. **Previous Project Performance:** The similar project in the same district (""Greening Croix de Pierre"") ranked 47th with 79 votes, suggesting a baseline of interest that could be comparable or slightly higher due to increased project scope.
5. **Voter Turnout and Engagement:** With an expected higher turnout, there might be a slight increase in the total votes, but this also means more competition.
6. **Project Visibility and Appeal:** The project's appeal will depend on how effectively it is marketed and its perceived impact on improving the district's aesthetics and environment.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the high cost, even with a reasonable number of votes, the project might be skipped if earlier projects exhaust the budget.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Redevelopment of the courtyard of the Borderouge nursery school
- Cost: 60000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 9 - Trois Cocus / Borderouge / Croix-Daurade / Pal√©ficat / Grand Selve
- Description: The greening of schoolyards (""oasis courtyards"") has widely demonstrated its benefits for our children: adapting our infrastructure to climate warming and the now inevitable heatwaves, as well as familiarizing our children with nature. We therefore request the creation of an oasis courtyard at the Borderouge preschool, which is particularly concreted. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The Toulouse City Hall has launched a program to develop schoolyards to meet the challenges of cooling, but also inclusion and diversity in these spaces for play and learning. This program is planned with regard to multi-criteria priorities, taking into account factors such as shade, soil, etc. The courtyard of the Borderouge preschool has not been classified among the highest priority given its recent redevelopment. If this idea were accepted, this schoolyard could potentially benefit from new plantings and the installation of a play area in the existing soil spaces.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, the cost relative to the budget, and its alignment with prevalent community needs and values. Projects in districts with higher engagement or those addressing more urgent or popular issues tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of the Project ""Redevelopment of the courtyard of the Borderouge nursery school"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 9 had moderate engagement in the previous year, with the highest voted project receiving 111 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of community participation but not the highest.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨60,000, the project is moderately priced, which may make it more feasible to be funded within the budget constraints compared to higher-cost projects.
3. **Project Theme:** The project focuses on greening and adapting school infrastructure for climate resilience, which aligns with current environmental concerns and could appeal to voters interested in sustainability and children's welfare.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects in other districts received a moderate number of votes, suggesting a consistent but not overwhelming interest in such initiatives.
5. **Previous District Project Performance:** The most similar project in the same district last year (Greening of the exterior walls of the Grand Selve school) received only 10 votes, indicating potential challenges in garnering high voter turnout for this specific type of project in this district.
6. **Overall Appeal and Visibility:** The project's success will depend significantly on its visibility and the campaign's effectiveness in the community, considering the moderate historical engagement in this district.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Self-service bicycle pumps, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing widespread issues tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the project ""Self-service bicycle pumps"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 19 had a moderate performance in the previous election, with projects receiving a range of votes but none breaking into the top 10.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨20,000, the project is relatively low-cost, which could allow it to be funded even if it doesn't receive the highest number of votes.
3. **Relevance and Appeal:** The project addresses a practical need for cyclists, which aligns with a growing trend towards eco-friendly transportation and could appeal to environmentally conscious voters.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar small-scale, bike-related projects in other districts received moderate interest, suggesting a potential for a decent number of votes but not necessarily top-tier performance.
5. **Visibility and Specificity:** The project's success might depend on its visibility and how well it is marketed to the electorate, especially in a district with mixed voting results.
6. **Overall District Engagement:** The average votes per project in District 19 were around 49.8, which suggests a moderate level of engagement compared to more active districts.
7. **Expected Turnout and Competition:** With an increased turnout expected and 183 projects in the running, the competition might dilute the votes across more projects, affecting the potential vote count for any single project.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Create toilets for the Column and Observatory gardens
- Cost: 100000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 4 - Lapujade / Bonnefoy / P√©riole / Marengo / La Colonne
- Description: The Column and Observatory gardens house children's play areas and host occasional events (open-air cinema, etc.), attracting a diverse audience. In summer, locals also visit to enjoy some coolness. However, neither the two parks nor the neighborhood provide restrooms, which causes inconvenience for users and discourages their attendance. It would be beneficial to install public toilets in close proximity to these two parks to enhance user comfort. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It is conceivable to create public toilets near these gardens. However, the Column and Observatory gardens are listed as Historical Monuments. Similarly, the fence, garden, and stable are registered as historical monuments. Should the vote be successful, a file after studies should therefore be submitted to the DRAC (Ministry of Culture) at the time of applying for the Building Permit. Additionally, work to connect to various underground networks will need to be carried out.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Create toilets for the Column and Observatory gardens, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing more widely felt needs tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of ""Create toilets for the Column and Observatory gardens"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 4 had a moderate average vote count in 2022, with the most popular project receiving 115 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of engagement but not the highest in the city.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨100,000, the cost is substantial but not excessively high, which might not deter its funding if it garners enough votes.
3. **Utility and Appeal:** The project addresses a clear need for public amenities in parks, which could appeal to a broad demographic, especially families and event-goers.
4. **Historical and Regulatory Considerations:** The need for approvals from the DRAC due to the historical status of the location might concern some voters about potential delays or complications.
5. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar utility projects like public toilets in other districts received relatively low votes, suggesting that while the need is recognized, it might not be the highest priority for voters.
6. **Project Visibility and Advocacy:** The success of the project could depend significantly on how well it is promoted and the public's awareness of the issues it aims to solve.
7. **Expected Higher Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout in the upcoming election, the project might receive more votes than similar projects in the past, provided it resonates well with the increased voter base.

384;105;82;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: A widened sidewalk on All√©e Serge Ravanel, near the Jardin des Plantes
- Cost: 230000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 5 - Saint-Michel / Saint-Agne / Empalot / Le Busca / Ile du Ramier / Monplaisir
- Description: Serge Ravenel Alley, the sidewalk along the Jardin des Plantes and to the left of the Capitole gate has been widened and paved with permeable joints. I wish that the sidewalk to the right of the Capitole gate, which is very narrow, be widened (by removing parking) and redone with paving stones and permeable joints, thus a bike lane will also be created. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: This request has been accepted. The sidewalk on the north side of Serge Ravanel Alleys, next to the Jardin des Plantes, can be widened and paved, continuing the arrangement made in 2023. Similarly, a cycling lane can also be marked up to the Grand Rond. This arrangement would remove about 30 existing parking spaces.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of votes among competing projects within the same district or with similar themes.

**Analysis of the Project: A widened sidewalk on All√©e Serge Ravanel, near the Jardin des Plantes**
1. **District Voting History**: District 5 has shown strong support for infrastructure and greening projects, with previous similar projects receiving substantial votes (e.g., 178 votes for a development project at a cost of ‚Ç¨200,000).
2. **Project Cost and Budget Impact**: The project cost (‚Ç¨230,000) is high, which might limit its feasibility under the budget cap, especially if there are many other popular lower-cost projects.
3. **Theme and Relevance**: The project aligns with popular themes of pedestrian and cycling infrastructure improvement, which have historically garnered significant voter support in Toulouse.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in terms of theme and district have ranked well, suggesting a potentially strong voter base for this project.
5. **Increased Voter Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, there might be a broader distribution of votes, which could affect the project's ranking positively or negatively depending on the competition.
6. **Project Visibility and Community Impact**: The project's impact on a well-known area near Jardin des Plantes may increase its visibility and perceived value, potentially boosting voter support.
7. **Budget Allocation Dynamics**: Given the greedy algorithm used for funding, the project's higher cost might be a disadvantage if the budget runs low after funding several lower-cost projects.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: More bike racks at the Cabanis Library
- Cost: 8000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 4 - Lapujade / Bonnefoy / P√©riole / Marengo / La Colonne
- Description: There are already several bike racks near the Cabanis library, but they are very insufficient, and people are forced to lock their bikes to the library barriers, trash cans, etc., and they are everywhere. Adding a large bike rack, the size of the 2 pre-existing ones, would be very useful! üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal to implement bike parking around the Cabanis media library has been accepted. Bike racks in continuation of those existing on Rue Ren√© Leduc will be installed. Moreover, as part of the ongoing study for the installation of street furniture in Marengo Square, which aims to harmonize the urban furniture in the square, additional bike supports could be installed, subject to technical constraints and the opinion of the ABF.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Install a bike shelter at the entrance of Paul Bert Elementary School
- Cost: 1000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 14 - Saint-Simon / Lafourguette / Oncopole-Campus Sant√© du Futur
- Description: Paul Bert Elementary School has several bike racks inside the school at the entrance; however, these racks are not sheltered. The inability to protect bikes and scooters from the elements is a deterrent to using these modes of transportation in bad weather. Facilitating and making the use of sustainable transport options more practical will undoubtedly help reduce the severe traffic congestion in front of the school in the mornings, especially on rainy days. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of a bike shelter at the entrance of Paul Bert School to protect the children's bikes in case of bad weather.

- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost-effectiveness. Projects in districts with historically higher engagement or those addressing widespread issues tend to perform better.

1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The project's low cost (‚Ç¨1000) makes it highly cost-effective, allowing it to be easily funded within the budget constraints.
2. **District Voting History**: District 14 has shown moderate engagement, with projects receiving a decent number of votes but not typically topping the charts.
3. **Relevance and Practicality**: The project addresses a practical need, which is likely to resonate well with voters, especially parents and school staff.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar low-cost, high-utility projects in other districts have received a moderate number of votes.

6. **Social and Ecological Appeal**: The project promotes sustainable transportation, aligning with broader social and ecological goals, which could attract additional support.
7. **Limited Competition in District**: With only 10 projects in the district, the competition level allows for potentially higher individual project visibility.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Follow the bike path all along the Gabardie road., listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widespread concerns tend to perform better.

**Analysis of ""Follow the bike path all along the Gabardie road."":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 10 had a moderate average vote count in 2022, with projects like a sports complex and park renovation receiving substantial support, indicating active local participation.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨50,000, the project is relatively affordable, which could allow it to be funded even after higher-cost projects, enhancing its chances of selection.
3. **Relevance and Urgency:** The project addresses safety concerns for cyclists, a pressing issue that could resonate well with the community, potentially increasing its appeal.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar bike path projects across the city received a wide range of votes, but those with a safety component or in districts with active cycling communities tended to perform better.
5. **Trend in Cycling Infrastructure:** There is a growing trend and demand for better cycling infrastructure in urban areas, which could work in favor of this project.
6. **Project Visibility and Campaign:** The success will partly depend on how effectively the project is campaigned and its visibility among voters.
7. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, projects that resonate with a broad audience or address urgent needs are likely to receive more votes.

391;101;87;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Greening and de-asphalting of Compans Street
- Cost: 235000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 4 - Lapujade / Bonnefoy / P√©riole / Marengo / La Colonne
- Description: Depaving and greening of Compans Street as in the 3 Pillars Street at Arnaud Bernard. The objectives are both ecological and aesthetic:
- Combat the intensifying heatwaves
- Reduce flooding by better absorbing excess water
- Increase biodiversity
- Add more greenery and color to the avenue
üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The section between Marengo Boulevard and Colonne Avenue has been recently redeveloped. Moreover, a gas pipeline is buried under the sidewalk on the residential side, meaning that the project would be over budget considering the costs of diverting networks. Additionally, no planting can be carried out on the railway side. The section between Colonne Avenue and Cimeti√®re Avenue, however, can be greened in line with the odd-numbered parking spaces, as the gas network runs on the other side of the street. Such a project would eliminate about 14 parking spaces.

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its cost relative to the total budget, and its district's voting history. Projects that address widespread concerns and are cost-effective tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Greening and de-asphalting of Compans Street"":**
1. **High Cost**: At ‚Ç¨235,000, this project is relatively expensive, which could hinder its ability to be funded within the budget constraints, especially if there are many other popular but less expensive projects.
2. **District Voting History**: District 4 had an average vote count of around 41 per project in the previous election, which is lower than some other districts. This might suggest a lower voter engagement or interest in this district.
3. **Project Theme**: The project's focus on ecological and aesthetic improvements is in line with popular themes in other districts, which could attract a significant number of votes.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar greening projects in other districts received a moderate number of votes, suggesting a consistent but not overwhelming interest in such projects.
5. **Technical Challenges**: The project involves complex issues like gas pipeline diversion and loss of parking spaces, which might deter some voters due to the potential inconvenience and increased costs.
6. **Previous District Projects**: The most voted project in this district in the last election received 115 votes, which could be seen as a ceiling for this type of project in this area.
7. **Increased Voter Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, there might be a slight increase in votes for all projects, but this does not necessarily translate to a top ranking due to the project's high cost and specific challenges.

312;100;88;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Make the Place de la Cit√© de l'Hers more welcoming, in summer and winter, with a canopy for the heart of the Ch√¢teau de l'Hers neighborhood.
- Cost: 150000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 11 - Bonhoure / Guilhem√©ry / Ch√¢teau de l'Hers / Limayrac / C√¥te Pav√©e
- Description: The square designed as the heart of the Hers district in front of the shops at the ""rotonde / le champignon"" is very stony, and the 6 trees planted will only provide shade in a few years. I propose the installation of a shade structure on this square to make it more pleasant on sunny days. This shade structure would meet the challenges of a cooler Toulouse. Its installation must be compatible with the organization of the weekly market. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea of a shade structure is acceptable, either planted or weighted depending on the square's surface, and its shape could be in harmony with the rest of the development. Additional trees could also be planted. Regarding lighting: recent devices less than 10 years old, LED, and a lighter surface coating for beautiful luminescence already exist.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Make the Place de la Cit√© de l'Hers more welcoming, in summer and winter, with a canopy for the heart of the Ch√¢teau de l'Hers neighborhood., listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing widespread issues tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Make the Place de la Cit√© de l'Hers more welcoming"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 11 has a moderate voting engagement with an average of 43.6 votes per project, which is lower than some other districts.
2. **Cost Comparison:** The project cost (‚Ç¨150,000) is substantial but aligns with other moderately successful projects in the same district and similar districts.
3. **Project Theme:** The project focuses on urban greening and comfort, themes that have shown moderate popularity in previous elections.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects in other districts received a range of votes but generally did not top the charts, suggesting a mid-tier popularity.
5. **District-Specific Comparisons:** The most voted project in District 11 in the previous year had 103 votes, setting a possible upper limit for similar projects.
6. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it is feasible but might not be prioritized over lower-cost or higher-vote projects.
7. **Expected Turnout and Vote Distribution:** With an increased turnout expected, the project might gain more votes but also faces more competition.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Replant Sacarin Garden, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects.

**Analysis of the Project ""Replant Sacarin Garden"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 11 has shown moderate interest in similar greening projects, with projects like ""Canal du Midi bank landscaping"" and ""Plant trees between the ring road and the greenway of the Hers"" receiving 103 and 94 votes respectively.
2. **Cost Comparison:** The cost of ""Replant Sacarin Garden"" (‚Ç¨50,000) is moderate and similar to previously proposed projects in the same district, which have seen a decent number of votes.
3. **Project Theme:** Greening projects have been moderately popular across Toulouse, suggesting a consistent but not overwhelming voter interest.
4. **Previous Project Performance:** Similar projects in the district have ranked around the middle of the pack, suggesting that while there is interest, it is not among the highest priorities for voters.
5. **Budget Constraints:** With a total budget of ‚Ç¨8,000,000 and the project's cost being relatively low, it is feasible within budget constraints, assuming similar budgeting as the previous year.
6. **Voter Turnout and Distribution:** With an expected higher turnout and each voter having up to three votes, the project could potentially receive more votes if it resonates well with the community's current interests.
7. **Competition:** The project faces competition from 182 other projects, and its success will partly depend on the nature and appeal of these competing initiatives.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Terrace Road: promoting cohabitation between motorized vehicles and cyclists
- Cost: 20000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 12 - Pont des Demoiselles / Ormeau / Montaudran / La Terrasse / Malep√®re
- Description: Removing the central reservation and adding bike lanes would be counterproductive: the speed of motor vehicles would increase due to the wider roadways. This road would become a ""Gonin Avenue"" / ""V√©drines Street"" / ""Didier Daurat Avenue"" ""bis"". Proposal: draw bike chevrons in the center of the roadway to legitimize cyclists and use some extra widths to allow motor vehicles to overtake. Reference: https://velobs.2p2r.org/index.php?id=812üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Adding bike logos and double chevrons not in the center of the street but at 1.50m from the sidewalk edge remains possible.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of votes among competing projects. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing widespread or critical needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project: Installation of Benches in the Sauzelong Neighborhood**

1. **District Voting History**: District 13 had a moderate average vote count in 2022, with projects like fruit tree plantations and observatory site development receiving substantial support (116 and 101 votes respectively). This suggests a community interest in local improvements.

2. **Project Relevance and Target Audience**: The project targets elderly people and those with reduced mobility, addressing a specific and urgent need for urban furniture, which can increase its appeal.

3. **Cost-Effectiveness**: At ‚Ç¨20,000, the project is relatively low-cost compared to other proposals, potentially allowing it to be funded even if it doesn't top the vote count, as it represents a smaller portion of the total budget.

4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar small-scale, local improvement projects (like the installation of game tables or public toilets in other districts) received a lower number of votes. However, the specific targeting of elderly and mobility-reduced individuals could differentiate it positively.

5. **Expected Increased Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout in the upcoming election, there might be a broader distribution of votes, which could affect the project's ranking positively or negatively depending on voter priorities.

6. **Project Visibility and Promotion**: The success of the project could hinge significantly on how well it is promoted and the community's awareness of the voting process.

7. **Competition Within the District**: With 8 projects submitted in District 13, competition is relatively high, which might split the vote, affecting the total votes this project might receive.

Based on these points, here is the estimated outcome for the project:

```json
{
  ""estimated_votes"": 90,
  ""confidence_interval"": [70, 110],
  ""expected_position"": 40,
  ""likely_in_top_5"": 0,
  ""likely_in_top_10"": 0
}

364;96;92;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with historically higher engagement or those addressing widely felt issues tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Renovate the Gabriel Koenings underpass"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 16 has shown moderate engagement in past elections, with projects receiving a range of votes but generally not reaching the very top ranks.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨25,000, the project is relatively affordable, which could allow it to be funded even if it doesn't receive the highest number of votes.
3. **Project Appeal:** The project addresses a practical and aesthetic issue, which could appeal to daily users of the underpass, enhancing its potential to gather votes.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar infrastructure and beautification projects have received a moderate number of votes, suggesting a consistent but not overwhelming interest in such projects.
5. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes than similar projects in previous years, but this also increases competition.
6. **Social Relevance:** The project's focus on improving a commonly used but neglected space could resonate well with the local community, potentially boosting its vote count.
7. **Visibility and Campaigning:** The success of the project could also depend on how effectively it is promoted during the campaigning period.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Installation of plant structures on Rue de l'Orient
- Cost: 50000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
- Description: Every day, families walk along the streets of l'Orient and Saint-Orens to take their children to school. These streets need to be calmed and closed to traffic. Access to private parking must be preserved. Replace parking spaces with planters, children's play areas, street furniture, and dog parks. Install manual barriers for security. Create opportunities to use the space for flea markets, festivals, meals, and entertainment. Create a pedestrian and bicycle path. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Pedestrianizing the axis from rue de l'Orient to Saint Orens cannot be considered under this scheme. Indeed, this axis is very long and such a proposal would require a comprehensive review of the traffic plan and a study of an arrangement that integrates the updating of public spaces in terms of accessibility, soft mobility, etc. Such a project is not compatible with the deadlines and costs associated with this participatory budget. However, a consultation must be initiated before the end of the year as part of the redevelopment project of Place Jeanne d'Arc: this axis should be included in the study perimeter. Nevertheless, a specific arrangement on the only section of the widened sidewalk (opposite the impasse de l'Orient) with the possible removal of 2 parking spaces (corner of rue Raymond IV) could be carried out with the installation of ""vegetal structures"" that would enhance and cool the street. This project will be feasible subject to compatibility with existing networks and prior approval from the ABF.

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing widespread concerns tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Installation of plant structures on Rue de l'Orient"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 3 has shown moderate interest in similar greening projects, with projects like ""Greening Matabiau Street"" receiving 95 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of community interest in such initiatives.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** The project cost (‚Ç¨50,000) is relatively low compared to other similar projects, which could make it more likely to be funded within the budget constraints.
3. **Project Theme:** The focus on greening and pedestrian safety aligns with popular themes in other successful projects across the city, indicating potential voter support.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in the same district have garnered around 50 to 95 votes. Given the moderate cost and appealing theme, this project might perform similarly or slightly better.
5. **Voter Turnout and Distribution:** With an expected higher turnout and each voter having up to three votes, the project could benefit if it effectively captures the district's interest.
6. **Project Specifics and Limitations:** The project description mentions limitations and a phased approach, which might affect its appeal if voters prefer more comprehensive solutions.
7. **Overall Appeal and Visibility:** The project's success will depend significantly on its visibility and the campaign's effectiveness in the context of other competing proposals.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Planting an orchard at the Cl√©mence Isaure Garden
- Cost: 20000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 6 - Saint-Cyprien
- Description: Cl√©mence Isaure Garden has a grassy area (opposite 133 rue des Arcs Saint-Cyprien) that is little frequented. If the soil permits, it could be a beautiful spot for planting fruit trees and shrubs, with harvests spread throughout the season (apricots, apples, pears, hazelnuts, raspberries, currants). In addition to providing small pickings for the residents of the neighborhood and the students of the adjoining college, this urban orchard would allow for a better understanding of the seasonality of harvests. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It is possible to plant fruit trees at the back of Cl√©mence Isaure square, provided that a study on soil pollution is negative. The available space being very limited in the square, the possibility of planting trees will presumably be limited to 5 fruit trees.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Refurbishment of the existing ramp for access to the Garonne dike (av. de Muret) from the parking area below the Fer √† Cheval.
- Cost: 150000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 6 - Saint-Cyprien
- Description: Access to the dike via the dead-end at the washhouse can only be achieved by a staircase, which is inconvenient for pedestrians and unsuitable for bicycles. Transforming this dead-end into a passage for bicycles and pedestrians would allow easy access to the dike from Avenue de Muret. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: An improvement of the access from the parking area below the Fer √† Cheval to the top of the dike is proposed (ground refurbishment, signposting, replacement of concrete walls...), subject to technical feasibility. Regulatory and technical reasons do not allow for the construction of a ramp on the dead-end of the Lavoir. Indeed, any development project must be accessible to people with reduced mobility. Therefore, if a ramp for pedestrians and bicycles were to be constructed at the end of the dead-end, it would have to comply with regulatory standards of a 4% slope with a resting platform every 10 meters. Here, there is about 2 meters between the level of the dead-end and the level of the dike. This would require a development of at least 50 linear meters, which is not feasible given the depth (about 6 meters) of the space at the end of the dead-end.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Refurbishment of the existing ramp for access to the Garonne dike"":**

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Installation of a traffic light at the crossing at the intersection of Chemin du Sang-de-Serp and Boulevard de l'Embouchure.
- Cost: 80000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 8 - Minimes / Barri√®re de Paris / Ponts-Jumeaux / La Vache / Raisins / Fondeyre
- Description: The high speed of vehicles along the Canal du Midi axis makes the use of pedestrian crossings without lights impossible. This is particularly the case for the one located under the Haedens footbridge: we therefore propose to install a push-button activated traffic light at this location. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: There is a study available that allows for the upgrading of the bus stop, the installation of a traffic light, and the securing of the pedestrian crossing, with the estimated cost of the works exceeding the budget of ‚Ç¨250,000 per idea within the framework of the Participatory Budget regulation. Moreover, the Grand Parc Canal project may impact this route. It seems more prudent to wait to have a clear view of the planned developments. In compensation, the Sang de Serp intersection is equipped with ducting, allowing for the activation of a traffic light and the necessary additional arrangement for the cycle path at this location.

4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in terms of theme and district have received a moderate number of votes (ranging from 43 to 145 votes).
5. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, projects might receive a slightly higher number of votes across the board.
6. **Project Urgency and Visibility:** The project addresses a specific and potentially urgent need for safety, which could increase its appeal.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it is feasible for this project to be funded without immediately exhausting available funds.

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, relevance to community needs, and cost-effectiveness. Projects in districts with higher engagement or those addressing widespread concerns tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Secure bicycle parking at Place Job"":**
1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The project's low cost (‚Ç¨4,000) makes it highly feasible within the budget constraints, allowing it to be funded even after higher-cost projects.
2. **District Voting Trends**: District 7 had moderate engagement in the previous election, with the highest voted project receiving 61 votes. This suggests a mid-level community interest.
3. **Project Theme**: Bicycle-related projects have shown varied success across the city, but generally, smaller-scale, lower-cost projects like bike racks have received moderate support.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar low-cost projects in other districts received votes ranging from 42 to 75, suggesting a potential for decent voter turnout.
5. **Community Impact**: The project addresses a practical and specific need, which might not be as compelling as broader infrastructure projects but still relevant to daily cyclists.
6. **Visibility and Awareness**: The project's success will depend significantly on how well it is marketed and its perceived importance among the voters in the district.
7. **Historical Data from Similar Projects**: Projects enhancing cyclist safety and convenience tend to perform moderately well, suggesting a similar trajectory for this project.

285;88;99;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing more pressing community issues tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of the Project ""Mosquito Control in Pal√©ficat"":**
1. **Cost Efficiency**: The project's low cost (‚Ç¨1000) makes it a financially attractive option, allowing it to be easily funded within the budget constraints.
2. **District Voting History**: District 9 has shown moderate engagement in previous elections, with similar mosquito-related projects receiving a decent number of votes (e.g., 111 votes for a ‚Ç¨60,000 project).
3. **Project Theme Relevance**: Mosquito control is a recurring theme, indicating ongoing community concern which could drive voter interest.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in other districts have garnered significant support (e.g., 258 votes in District 12), suggesting a potentially strong voter base for this theme.
5. **Project Visibility and Urgency**: Given the practical and immediate benefits of mosquito control, the project is likely to be perceived as both urgent and beneficial, increasing its appeal.
6. **Historical Data from Similar Projects**: Projects with a similar focus in the same district have shown varied results, but generally positive, indicating a baseline level of support.
7. **Expected Higher Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, more votes might be distributed across projects, but impactful and low-cost projects like this one could stand out more.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Create shade and green the forecourt of the Grand M media library, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its cost relative to the budget, and its district's voting history and demographic engagement.

**Analysis of ""Create shade and green the forecourt of the Grand M media library"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 17 has historically low voter engagement and support for projects, with the highest voted project receiving only 33 votes in the previous year.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is relatively expensive, which could hinder its funding if the budget becomes constrained.
3. **Project Theme:** Greening and shading projects have mixed popularity across the city, but they tend to receive moderate support, especially in districts with higher engagement.
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Similar projects in more active districts received more votes, suggesting that the theme is generally well-received but might underperform in less engaged districts.
5. **Voter Turnout and Distribution:** With an expected higher turnout, there might be a slight increase in votes, but the historical data from District 17 suggests it will remain relatively low.
6. **Budget Allocation:** Given the high cost and the district's low voting turnout, it's unlikely that this project will be prioritized over smaller, potentially more popular projects in other districts.
7. **Overall Appeal:** While the project addresses a real need (shade and cooling), its success heavily depends on increased voter mobilization in a historically low-engagement area.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Greening and de-asphalting of Cemetery Avenue
- Cost: 250000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 4 - Lapujade / Bonnefoy / P√©riole / Marengo / La Colonne
- Description: Depaving under certain trees on Cemetery Avenue (those without parking spaces, bike racks, or electric charging stations). As in front of 24 Cemetery Avenue and Rue des 3 Piliers at Arnaud Bernard. The goals are both ecological and aesthetic:
Reduce flooding by allowing better absorption of excess water, which will benefit the trees
Improve soil quality for the trees
Increase biodiversity
Add more greenery and color to the avenue
üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Cemetery Avenue could be depaved in two types of areas (75 diagonal parking spaces and spaces between tree bases). Initially, the project could extend from Saint Paul Street to the cemetery parking lot. Then, in a second phase (outside the participatory budget), on the parking lot directly in front of the cemetery entrance. The project would involve removing the existing pavement between the tree bases and replacing it with grassed concrete slabs that allow for vehicle parking. This would reduce the amount of paved surface while still maintaining on-street parking availability. Such a project would need to be reviewed by SDIS 31 to ensure compatibility with fire service access to buildings. Finally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green these streets. Facades, for example, can be greened at the owner's request, with support from the community. The owner must also commit to maintaining the planters in the long term. This initiative will be subject to technical feasibility conditions: no underground networks, no basements or crawl spaces, and pedestrian continuity must be maintained. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the city and metropolitan technical services once residents submit their requests via the online form available on the community's website.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Greening and de-asphalting of Cemetery Avenue, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher engagement and fewer competing proposals tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Greening and de-asphalting of Cemetery Avenue"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 4 had a moderate average vote count in 2022, with the most popular project receiving 115 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of engagement but not the highest in the city.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is relatively expensive, which could limit its feasibility under the budget cap, especially if there are many other popular lower-cost projects.
3. **Project Theme:** Greening projects have been moderately popular across the city, but not top-tier in terms of votes, typically ranking outside the top 20.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects in other districts received votes ranging from 21 to 115, indicating varied but not overwhelming support.
5. **Local Competition:** With 6 projects submitted in District 4 this year, the competition is moderate, which might dilute the total votes for each project.
6. **Project Appeal:** The ecological and aesthetic benefits are likely to appeal to environmentally conscious voters, but the project's impact might be perceived as localized rather than city-wide.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of this project, it would need a significant proportion of votes to be funded, which might be challenging given historical data.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm that prioritizes projects in descending order of votes until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of votes across various projects and districts.

**Analysis of the Project: Installation of a street workout module in the future Dortis Park**

1. **District Voting History**: District 7 has shown moderate interest in similar projects, with sports and recreational projects receiving a range of 25 to 59 votes in the previous election.
2. **Project Cost**: At ‚Ç¨40,000, the project is moderately priced, which could make it more appealing compared to higher-cost projects, potentially allowing it to be funded after more expensive projects are passed over due to budget constraints.
3. **Project Theme and Appeal**: The project promotes physical activity and social cohesion, themes that have resonated well across various districts, suggesting a potentially higher voter interest.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in the same district have garnered up to 59 votes, indicating a reasonable expectation for this project to attract a similar or slightly higher number of votes due to its moderate cost and broad appeal.
5. **Expected Voter Turnout and Project Competition**: With an increased voter turnout expected and 183 projects competing, the project might face stiff competition, affecting its total votes and ranking.
6. **Historical Data and Ranking**: Projects in this district with similar themes have not typically ranked in the top 10, suggesting a challenge for this project to break into the top ranks.
7. **Budget Constraints**: Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it is feasible within the budget constraints, but its final funding will heavily depend on its vote count relative to other projects.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Action for the removal of the illegal dump at Jean Chaubet by planting vegetation
- Cost: 40000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 11 - Bonhoure / Guilhem√©ry / Ch√¢teau de l'Hers / Limayrac / C√¥te Pav√©e
- Description: At the corner of Rue Moni√© and Avenue Jean Chaubet, a small bitumen triangle of a few square meters has been used as an illegal dump for over 30 years. Why has the city council never addressed this known public hygiene issue? To deter polluters, it would be necessary to decontaminate the soil to allow grass and some plants to grow, and also to install anti-car bollards to prevent vehicles from accessing the site, from which washing machines, sofas, and other trash bags are unloaded at night. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It seems indeed that there are few voluntary drop-off points (PAV) in the neighborhood because few locations are suitable for the dimensions of the PAVs: the idea is acceptable. Depending on the site and soil constraints, count ‚Ç¨4000 per planting pit and tree. These plantings could be complemented by ground-cover plants at the base of trees and shrubs.

Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Action for the removal of the illegal dump at Jean Chaubet by planting vegetation, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of votes among competing projects within the same district or with similar themes.

**Analysis of the Project: Action for the Removal of the Illegal Dump at Jean Chaubet by Planting Vegetation**
1. **District Voting History**: District 11 has shown moderate interest in similar greening projects, with projects like ""Neighborhood Greening"" receiving 68 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of community interest in environmental improvements.
2. **Project Cost**: At ‚Ç¨40,000, the project is moderately priced, which could make it more likely to be funded after higher-voted, more expensive projects have exhausted available funds.
3. **Community Impact and Visibility**: The project addresses a long-standing public hygiene issue, which could resonate well with local voters seeking tangible improvements in their immediate environment.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar greening projects across the city have received a wide range of votes, but generally, projects under ‚Ç¨50,000 tend to perform better in terms of vote acquisition.
5. **Voter Turnout and Engagement**: With an expected higher turnout, there might be more votes cast overall, which could dilute the impact of highly committed voter groups unless the project garners widespread attention.
6. **Project Theme Relevance**: The theme of converting an illegal dump into a green space aligns with contemporary urban environmental concerns, potentially attracting voters interested in sustainability and urban quality of life.
7. **Historical Data from Similar Projects**: Projects with a focus on small-scale environmental transformation in similar budget ranges have historically ranked in the middle tiers, suggesting a potential for a solid but not top-tier performance.

292;82;104;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Mark the pedestrian crossings and slow down traffic on Gabriel P√©ri and d'Aubuisson streets.
- Cost: 40000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
- Description: üí° THE IDEA EXPRESSED BY @MikaTlse: First on Gabriel P√©ri street, then Riquet, Aubuisson, and wherever the speed is too high. The targeted vehicles are cars but also two-wheelers! It would be necessary to install speed bumps with a gentler slope across the entire length of the crossing (to prevent two-wheelers from swerving to avoid them). Do this primarily for major roads: to slow down traffic, for pedestrian safety, and for vehicles that are victims of right-of-way violations. Adjust the number based on cost. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Arrangements can be proposed on Gabriel P√©ri and Aubuisson streets, as Riquet street has just been completely redesigned with the integration of devices that encourage speed reduction. Speed bumps/Berlin cushions could be installed on these two streets near pedestrian crossings and intersections, to reduce vehicle speed. However, prior road counts must be carried out to confirm this issue.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

5. **Expected Increased Turnout:** With a higher voter turnout expected, projects might receive a slightly higher number of votes across the board.
6. **Project Visibility and Advocacy:** The effectiveness of the project's promotion and the community's mobilization to support it will significantly impact its voting outcome.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of competing projects, this project's moderate cost gives it a better chance of being funded after more expensive projects are considered.

316;81;105;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Remove the asphalt from the TUC Rugby parking lot
- Cost: 187200.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 11 - Bonhoure / Guilhem√©ry / Ch√¢teau de l'Hers / Limayrac / C√¥te Pav√©e
- Description: The parking area of the TUC Rugby facilities on Rue C Rougenet is fully paved. In the era of climate change and the fight against heat islands, I propose that the parking be depaved to eliminate an impermeable surface (about 3000 m¬≤) and ""break up"" a heat island. To accommodate the parking usage, it could be fitted with solutions like evergreen slabs. If the cost exceeds ‚Ç¨250k, 2 phases could be considered. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Since the parking belongs to the city of Toulouse, it is possible to depave it.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Remove the asphalt from the TUC Rugby parking lot, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing popular themes like environmental sustainability tend to perform better.

**Analysis of ""Remove the asphalt from the TUC Rugby parking lot"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 11 has a moderate voting engagement with an average of 43.6 votes per project, which is below the city average.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨187,200, the project is moderately expensive, which could affect its funding chances if cheaper projects also gather high votes.
3. **Project Theme:** The environmental focus of the project aligns with popular themes in Toulouse, such as greening and combating heat islands, which have historically received a fair amount of support.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects across the city have received a wide range of votes, but generally not enough to break into the top ranks.
5. **Previous Similar Projects in District 11:** Similar projects in the same district, like ""Neighborhood Greening"" (‚Ç¨55,000 cost, 68 votes), suggest a moderate level of support for environmental initiatives.
6. **Voter Turnout and Distribution:** With a higher expected turnout and 183 projects competing, the vote distribution might be more spread out, potentially lowering the votes for any single project.
7. **Project Visibility and Appeal:** The project's success will heavily depend on its visibility and how well it is marketed to the residents, considering its environmental appeal.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Installing public toilets in the public garden of Pays d'Oc
- Cost: 50000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 5 - Saint-Michel / Saint-Agne / Empalot / Le Busca / Ile du Ramier / Monplaisir
- Description: The public garden in the Pays d'Oc (between Fran√ßois Longaud Street and Gallois Street) is very popular, especially with families, but there are no public toilets. It would be advisable to install some, such as composting toilets similar to those implemented at the Argoulets. These public toilets could be located, for example, near the entrance opposite Henri Tagn√®res Street (towards the transformer) or alternatively near the entrance on Gallois Street, slightly shifting the dog park. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The installation of a public restroom in the Pays d'Oc garden is not subject to any particular heritage-related approvals. However, the feasibility of such an installation remains subject to the compatibility with the underground networks of the street, to which the restroom would need to be connected.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Installing public toilets in the public garden of Pays d'Oc, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, with each voter allowed to choose up to three projects. The projects are then funded in descending order of votes until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to the public, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects.

**Analysis of the Project ""Installing public toilets in the public garden of Pays d'Oc"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 5 has shown moderate to high engagement in previous elections, with projects receiving a decent number of votes, suggesting a relatively active voting community.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨50,000, the project is moderately priced, which may make it more likely to be funded after higher-voted, more expensive projects have exhausted significant portions of the budget.
3. **Utility and Appeal:** The project addresses a clear need for public amenities in a popular area, which could drive higher voter interest compared to less essential projects.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar utility projects like public toilets in other districts have not ranked very high, indicating potential challenges in breaking into the top ranks.
5. **Project Visibility and Support:** The project's success will depend significantly on the campaigning and visibility it receives prior to the voting, as well as any endorsements or support from local community groups.
6. **Budget Constraints:** With a total budget of ‚Ç¨8,000,000 and considering the cost of other high-ranking projects, this project has a reasonable chance of being funded if it secures enough votes.
7. **Expected Voter Turnout Increase:** An expected higher turnout could either dilute or concentrate votes, depending on how many similar projects are competing in the same district or election overall.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects. District-specific voting patterns and historical voting data also play crucial roles.

**Analysis of the project Greening Rue de Gironis:**
1. **District Voting Patterns:** District 14 historically has lower average votes per project (around 40.4), suggesting a moderate level of engagement.
2. **Project Cost and Budget Impact:** The project cost (‚Ç¨100,000) is moderate and feasible within the total budget, assuming similar budget allocations as in 2022.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects in other districts received a range of votes (81 to 95), indicating potential for moderate popularity.
4. **Historical Data from District 14:** The most similar project in the same district, ""Eisenhower: Trees for Bike Paths,"" received 81 votes, suggesting a possible benchmark.
5. **Project Appeal:** The project addresses a practical and visible improvement (shade for a bike path), which could appeal to environmentally conscious voters and daily commuters.
6. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes than similar projects in previous years.
7. **Competition Within District:** The project competes with 9 other projects in the district, which could dilute its potential votes if other projects are more compelling.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Requalification and Greening of the Ducuing/Salade Ponsan/Vallon/Pouvourville Intersection
- Cost: 200000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 13 - Rangueil / Sauzelong / Jules-Julien / Pech-David / Pouvourville
- Description: This intersection is unnecessarily very wide, difficult to cross on foot and by bike, with many wasted spaces and fully paved central strips. I propose to reduce its size to a simple crossroads, without slip roads, and to depave and green all the reclaimed space. It would be a beautiful gateway to Pech David and the future Larrey OAP. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: After checking the underground congestion, this idea is feasible along with the planting of trees.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Requalification and Greening of the Ducuing/Salade Ponsan/Vallon/Pouvourville Intersection, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects with higher votes get priority, but very expensive projects may not be funded if they exceed the remaining budget.

**Analysis of the Project ""Requalification and Greening of the Ducuing/Salade Ponsan/Vallon/Pouvourville Intersection"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 13 had an average vote of 55.7 per project in 2022, indicating moderate engagement.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨200,000, the project is expensive, which could limit its funding chances if the budget is tight, despite high votes.
3. **Similar Project Performance:** Similar greening projects in other districts received a range of votes (37 to 178), suggesting variability based on specific local interests and project visibility.
4. **Previous Similar Project in the Same District:** A similar project in the same district (""De-seal and vegetate the Ducuing/Salade Ponsan intersection"") received only 38 votes, indicating potential low interest or poor visibility.
5. **Theme Relevance:** The project's focus on greening and improving pedestrian access aligns with popular themes in urban areas, potentially increasing its appeal.
6. **Increased Turnout Expectation:** With a higher expected turnout, there might be a slight increase in votes for all projects, but this does not necessarily translate to a proportionate increase for this specific project.
7. **Competition Within District:** With 8 projects in the district this year, competition for votes might dilute the total votes this project could potentially receive.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Basketball / Volleyball / Soccer Field in Lardenne
- Cost: 30000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 18 - Lardenne / Pradettes / Basso-Cambo
- Description: We know that music and sports are areas that contribute to the social well-being of young people. However, most activities in cultural centers require payment for annual participation. It would be great to also have free access to team sports in more neighborhoods (Lardenne, Minimes, etc.) similar to the stadium (where there is basketball, soccer, running, beach volleyball, tennis). Several spaces are abandoned. For example, there is no free basketball court in Lardenne. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: To complement the neighborhood's offerings in the Lardenne sector. Notably with the project to open the garden of the petit Capitole where there are already soccer/handball goals and a basketball hoop: an offer to be expanded.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of votes among competing projects within the same district or thematic area.

**Analysis of the Project: Basketball / Volleyball / Soccer Field in Lardenne**

1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The project's cost (‚Ç¨30,000) is relatively low compared to other projects in the same district and citywide, making it a financially attractive option within the available budget.
   
2. **District Voting History**: In 2022, projects in District 18 received a decent amount of support, with the top project garnering 189 votes. This suggests a moderate level of voter engagement and support for local initiatives.

3. **Project Theme and Appeal**: Sports and recreational facilities generally have broad appeal, especially in areas lacking such amenities. The project addresses a clear need for free access to sports facilities, potentially increasing its attractiveness to voters.

4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects, like the sports complex in District 10 and the health trail in the same district, received substantial votes (205 and 80 respectively), indicating a positive voter response to sports and health-related projects.

5. **Visibility and Awareness**: The project's success will partly depend on the campaigning and visibility efforts by proponents to ensure it is well-known among voters.

6. **Competition within the District**: With 9 projects submitted in District 18 for the current election, the competition is relatively high, which might dilute the votes among more projects.

7. **Historical Data and Trends**: Analyzing past similar projects, sports-related initiatives have performed variably, but the lower cost and high utility of this project should favor it.

8. **Expected Voter Turnout Increase**: With an expected higher turnout, more votes might be distributed among projects, but popular, well-understood projects like this one could benefit significantly.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Greening of Lejeune and Lancefoc Streets
- Cost: 145000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 2 - Amidonniers / Compans-Caffarelli / Brouardel
- Description: Hello, Like Embarthe Street, with our neighborhood association BALLH, we would like Lejeunes and Lancefoc streets to be greened in order to bring some coolness during the heatwave, greenery to be less concrete, to attract more biodiversity, to remove this excess of asphalt, to give a countryside look, etc... üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Generally, many networks are present in Lejeune and Lancefoc streets. Also, a greening project on these streets would require the prior diversion of networks, an operation incompatible with the deadlines and costs associated with this participatory budget. However, a redevelopment of the Lejeune / Lancefoc intersection aimed at reducing the lanes dedicated to traffic, by widening pedestrian public spaces, with a view to making plantings, is feasible. Finally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green this street. This initiative, after agreement from the concerned owners, is subject to technical feasibility conditions: no underground networks, no cellars or crawl spaces, pedestrian continuity to be respected. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the technical services of the city hall and the metropolis, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

375;77;111;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Improving the space for toddlers at the Compans Caffarelli garden, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the budget. Projects in districts with higher engagement or those addressing widespread concerns tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of the Project ""Improving the space for toddlers at the Compans Caffarelli garden"":**
1. **Cost Efficiency**: The project's low cost (‚Ç¨5,000) makes it a financially attractive option, allowing it to be easily funded within the budget constraints.
2. **District Voting History**: District 2 has shown moderate engagement, with projects receiving a range of votes but generally not reaching the very top except for highly appealing projects.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar small-scale projects in other districts have not garnered high vote counts, suggesting a potential ceiling on interest for small-scale improvements.
4. **Theme Relevance**: The project focuses on children and families, which can be a compelling demographic but might not have as broad an appeal as infrastructure projects.
5. **Previous District Projects Performance**: The most similar project in the same district in the previous year received only 17 votes, indicating potential limited interest in small-scale playground improvements.
6. **Visibility and Appeal**: The project's success will depend significantly on its visibility in the campaign phase and its perceived necessity and appeal among voters.
7. **Expected Higher Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes than similar projects in the past, but this does not necessarily imply a top ranking.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Greening near the Roman amphitheater"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 20 has shown moderate engagement, with projects like the reopening of green spaces receiving a significant number of votes (164 votes). This suggests a community interest in green and public space projects.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** The project cost (‚Ç¨50,000) is relatively low compared to other similar projects, which could allow it to be funded even if it doesn't top the vote count, as it represents a smaller portion of the total budget.
3. **Theme Popularity:** Greening projects have varied in popularity, but those in high-visibility or high-use areas tend to perform better. The integration with ongoing projects could enhance its appeal.
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Similar projects in other districts have received a decent number of votes, suggesting a general voter interest in greening projects.
5. **Project Specifics and Integration:** The project's integration with other developments could make it more appealing as it promises a broader impact than standalone projects.
6. **Previous Similar Project Performance:** A similar project in the same district (""Adding Trees to the Roman Arenas Neighborhood"") received only 19 votes, indicating potential challenges in voter interest or project visibility.
7. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might gain more votes if it effectively communicates its benefits and relevance to the community.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Tree Densification in the Bois de Ribaute
- Cost: 250000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 12 - Pont des Demoiselles / Ormeau / Montaudran / La Terrasse / Malep√®re
- Description: The educational forest of Ribaute covers an area of 32 hectares, and 537 trees and shrubs have been planted there. From a forestry perspective, as a green lung and the creation of green spaces for the future 20,000 inhabitants of the Malep√®re Marcaissone district, this is a start but clearly insufficient. With an average density of 800 trees per hectare, at least 25,000 more trees are needed. At an average cost of ‚Ç¨4,000 per hectare, this would amount to ‚Ç¨128,000. We would see the results in 20-30 years. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Given the budget, it is possible to plant an additional 300 trees in the Ribaute forest. The site will be secured beforehand.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Tree Densification in the Bois de Ribaute, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, relevance to a broad demographic, and the cost-effectiveness in terms of budget allocation. Projects in districts with historically higher engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of Tree Densification in the Bois de Ribaute:**
1. **District Voting History:** District 12 has shown strong voter engagement and support for projects, especially those related to environmental and community enhancements.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is relatively expensive, which might limit its funding chances if the budget becomes constrained.
3. **Environmental Appeal:** The project's focus on greening and sustainability aligns with popular trends in urban development, likely appealing to environmentally conscious voters.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects have received moderate to high votes, suggesting a consistent interest in such initiatives.
5. **Project Visibility and Impact:** The project promises significant long-term environmental impact, which could enhance its appeal.
6. **Budget Constraints:** Given the high cost, the project must compete with potentially lower-cost projects for limited funds, which could affect its ranking.
7. **Historical Data from Similar Projects:** Projects with similar themes and costs in the district have received a decent number of votes but varied rankings, indicating uncertainty in predicting exact voter support.

283;69;116;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Lighting of the Railway Tunnel connecting Vitry cul-de-sac to Barthe cul-de-sac
- Cost: 50000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 9 - Trois Cocus / Borderouge / Croix-Daurade / Pal√©ficat / Grand Selve
- Description: From Vitry dead-end to Barthe dead-end, one passes through a narrow, dimly lit railway tunnel that is very distressing. However, it is the shortest route to walk from 3-cocus to Minimes, or to the Lautrec Pool. To better illuminate it, I propose repainting the walls a light color, installing more effective lighting, possibly adjustable with a motion detector. And to install two emergency call stations in case of an unpleasant encounter or incident. Thank you. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The City Hall can repair the tunnel's spotlights, however, there are issues of incivility that make maintaining the system difficult.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the available budget. District-specific voting trends and the average number of votes per project also play crucial roles.

**Analysis of the Project ""Lighting of the Railway Tunnel connecting Vitry cul-de-sac to Barthe cul-de-sac"":**
1. **District Voting Trends:** District 9 had a moderate average vote count in 2022, with projects receiving between 0 and 111 votes. This suggests a mid-level engagement among voters in this district.
2. **Project Cost and Appeal:** The project cost (‚Ç¨50,000) is moderate and should not be a significant barrier to funding. The project addresses safety and accessibility, which are typically well-received themes.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar safety and lighting projects in other districts received a decent number of votes, such as the ""Motion sensor night lighting"" in District 2 with 189 votes.
4. **Historical Data from District 9:** The most voted project in 2022 in this district received 111 votes. Given the similar nature and cost, this project might attract a comparable or slightly higher interest.
5. **Project Relevance and Urgency:** The project addresses a specific and potentially urgent need for safer passage through a poorly lit area, which could increase its appeal.
6. **Expected Increase in Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, there might be a proportional increase in votes for all projects, potentially benefiting this project if it resonates well with the community.
7. **Competition Within the District:** With 10 projects submitted in this district for the current year, the competition level is similar to the previous year, which could mean a distribution of votes similar to 2022.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Creation of a cycling signage between Basso Cambo and Guilhermy
- Cost: 10000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 14 - Saint-Simon / Lafourguette / Oncopole-Campus Sant√© du Futur
- Description: Due to the protective mounds, cyclists coming from Guilhermy along the dedicated bike path and wanting to go towards Basso Cambo do not always see the connection that passes under the large roundabout; there is a lack of signage at this location, and at the exit on the Moun√®de side. The same is true after crossing Saint Simon road; there are cyclists who cross Eisenhower because they have not seen the underpass, again due to a lack of signage. Ground markings need to be made. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of directional signs at the intersections of bike paths to identify existing bike path continuities.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Greening of the central reservations on the Route d'Espagne
- Cost: 250000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 15 - Croix de Pierre / Route d'Espagne
- Description: On the road to Spain, between the September 21 roundabout and the peripheral bridge, it would be advisable to remove the central median where there is no car crossing. Instead, given the width, a multitude of plants could be planted to cool down this street. This could be done in partnership with the children from the Oustalous school to raise their awareness of ecology. It would help to de-impermeabilize a good portion of the street and also prevent illegal parking. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Removal of asphalt and planting of vegetation on the central medians of the road to Spain in order to reduce the heat of this axis in summer.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Greening of the central reservations on the Route d'Espagne, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher average votes and those addressing popular themes like greening and cycling infrastructure tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Greening of the central reservations on the Route d'Espagne"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 15 has a moderate voting average (45.1 votes per project in 2022), which is lower than some of the more central districts.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is relatively expensive, which could limit its feasibility under the budget constraints unless it garners significant voter support.
3. **Theme Popularity:** Greening projects have shown varied success across the city, but they resonate well with current urban trends and environmental concerns.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** A similar greening project in the same district received 79 votes and ranked 47th, suggesting moderate interest.
5. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, there might be a slight increase in votes for all projects, potentially benefiting this project.
6. **Project Visibility and Impact:** The project's ecological and community involvement aspects (involving local school children) could enhance its appeal.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the high cost, the project must compete strongly in votes to be funded within the budget limits, especially against lower-cost projects.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Installation of bike racks in the Chalets district
- Cost: 3240.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
- Description: In the Chalets district, as well as throughout Toulouse, more and more bicycles are being parked on the streets in a very anarchic manner. The increasing use of bicycles only amplifies this phenomenon. Proposal: install bicycle parking in the streets in place of one or more car parking spaces. These exist but are very few. Consider other means of parking bicycles. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: To avoid the anarchic parking of bicycles in the Chalets district, the community proposes the installation of urban furniture such as bicycle racks. These installations can be carried out on car parking spaces of a single spot: this parking must be protected or ""integrated"" for safety and protection of cyclists. In this district, most streets have unprotected parking and narrow sidewalks that do not allow the addition of bicycle supports. However, Rue de la Balance (at the right of No. 40 on a 2-car parking space) and Rue des Chalets (about 7 vehicle spaces protected by curbs) could accommodate bicycle racks. If this idea were adopted, 9 vehicle parking spaces would be removed on these 2 streets.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Pedestrian network stroll, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of votes among competing projects within the same district or thematic area.

**Analysis of the Project ""Pedestrian network stroll"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 4 had a moderate voting turnout in the previous year, with the most voted project receiving 115 votes. This suggests a moderate level of engagement among voters in this district.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨40,000, the project is relatively affordable compared to other projects in the same district and city-wide, potentially making it more likely to be funded within the available budget.
3. **Project Theme:** The project focuses on urban walkability and enhancing district connectivity, which aligns with popular themes such as environmental sustainability and community development.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in other districts, especially those focusing on pedestrian and environmental improvements, have received a moderate number of votes, suggesting a consistent interest in such themes.
5. **Expected Higher Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, there might be a broader distribution of votes, which could affect the project's ranking positively or negatively depending on voter preferences.
6. **Project Visibility and Appeal:** The project's success will depend on its visibility and how well it is communicated and promoted among the residents of District 4.
7. **Competition Within District:** With 6 projects submitted in District 4 this year, the competition might dilute the votes, affecting the potential ranking of this project.

**Analysis of the project ""An Artwork at Croix de Pierre"":**
1. **District Voting History:** The district of Croix de Pierre / Route d'Espagne has shown moderate engagement in previous participatory budgeting, with projects receiving a range of votes but generally not reaching the very top ranks.
2. **Project Cost vs. Budget:** The project cost (‚Ç¨100,000) is substantial but not excessively high, which might not deter its potential for funding if it garners enough votes.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar artistic and community-focused projects in other districts have received a moderate number of votes, suggesting a niche but consistent interest in such initiatives.
4. **Previous Similar Project Performance:** The similar project ""Greening Croix de Pierre"" in the same district received 79 votes and ranked 47th, indicating a reasonable but not overwhelming interest in community and aesthetic enhancements in this area.
5. **Project Appeal and Relevance:** The project's focus on art and community space may appeal to local residents who value cultural development and the aesthetic improvement of public spaces, potentially increasing its vote count.
6. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes than similar projects in the past, although this will also increase competition.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it is feasible but would need a strong voter turnout to justify its expense relative to cheaper projects.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Installation of exercise equipment for muscle strengthening at Parc des Sept Deniers
- Cost: 10000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 7 - Sept Deniers / Ginestous-Sesqui√®res / Lalande
- Description: This park is rather underappreciated, even being transformed into a parking lot when there are matches at Stade Toulousain. It would be interesting to enhance its value to improve the living environment of the neighborhood in anticipation of its upcoming densification with the arrival of line C. For example, it would be interesting to take advantage of the available space to plant new trees and/or install a street workout type sports facility. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A section of the park will be developed to install a playground with a zip line as well as a city stadium. In order to avoid overloading with equipment and to maintain a natural space aspect, it is proposed to additionally install 4 muscle strengthening apparatuses: dip bars, pull-up bar, wall bars, and a ladder.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Installation of exercise equipment for muscle strengthening at Parc des Sept Deniers, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its cost relative to its perceived benefits, and the voting history and demographic engagement of the district it is proposed in.

**Analysis of the Project ""Installation of exercise equipment for muscle strengthening at Parc des Sept Deniers"":**
1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The project's relatively low cost (‚Ç¨10,000) compared to other projects increases its likelihood of being funded within the budget constraints.
2. **District Voting History**: District 7 has shown moderate engagement in previous elections, with projects receiving a range of votes but generally not reaching the top ranks.
3. **Similar Project Comparison**: Similar projects in the same district, like the ""Twin Bridges Green Zone"" and ""Develop the Parc des Sept-Deniers,"" received moderate votes (59 and 25 respectively), suggesting a consistent but limited interest in local sports and recreational facilities.
4. **Project Appeal**: The project aims to enhance a currently underutilized park, which could appeal to local residents looking for improved community amenities, potentially increasing its vote count.
5. **Voter Turnout and Distribution**: With an expected higher turnout and each voter having up to 3 votes, the project might benefit from increased overall participation, though votes will also be more distributed across the increased number of projects.
6. **Project Visibility and Promotion**: The success will partly depend on how well the project is promoted within the community and its visibility on the voting platform.
7. **Comparative Advantage**: The project's lower cost and practical benefit might give it an edge over more expensive proposals, especially in a budget-conscious voting environment.

268;61;123;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Access control at the entrance of Rue Cujas
- Cost: 100000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 1 - Capitole / Arnaud Bernard / Carmes
- Description: With travel already heavily restricted in the city center, the streets around the Place de la Bourse deserve to be pedestrianized. I am referring to the streets of Sainte Ursule, Bourse, Cl√©mence Isaure, Cujas, and Prieur√©. These streets, not renovated for too long, only serve as diversion routes, or to access other streets that are already closed. My proposal: control at the entrances of all these streets with bollards. The benefits: less noise, less pollution, less risk of accidents... üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The installation of barriers at the entrance of each of these streets cannot be considered within the framework of this call for ideas (due to budget and associated implementation timelines). Indeed, the implementation of automated access controls on all these roads requires the initiation of in-depth studies that cannot be carried out over the dedicated period. Moreover, the streets of Saint Ursule, Cl√©mence Isaure, Cujas, and Prieur√© deserve a comprehensive reflection in terms of planning, following the one carried out on Rue Gambetta. However, the installation of access control at the entrance of Rue Cujas can be considered within the framework of this call for ideas and initially, the buildings on this street do not have vehicle access. Such a project must nevertheless be submitted for the opinion of the Architecte des B√¢timents de France and subject to technical feasibility related to the presence of necessary networks. Additionally, it should be noted that a school street project is being studied for Rue du Prieur√© (Lakanal kindergarten).

Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to a wide audience, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widespread issues tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of the Project ""Access control at the entrance of Rue Cujas"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 1 has historically shown strong voter engagement and support for projects, with high average votes per project (136.9).
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨100,000, the project is moderately priced, which may allow it to be funded after higher-voted but more expensive projects are passed over due to budget constraints.
3. **Project Theme:** The project focuses on urban mobility and quality of life, themes that have resonated well in this district, as seen with similar projects like pedestrian paths and greening initiatives.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in terms of theme and district have garnered significant support, such as the pedestrian and bike paths project with 467 votes.
5. **Voter Turnout and Engagement:** With an expected higher turnout and the project's relevance to a central, densely populated area, it is likely to attract a considerable number of votes.
6. **Social and Ecological Relevance:** The project addresses current urban issues such as pollution and traffic, aligning with broader social and ecological concerns that may appeal to a wide audience.
7. **Visibility and Communication:** Assuming effective communication and visibility of the project proposal, it could replicate the success of similar past projects.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Tree-lined Debat Ponsan Avenue
- Cost: 204000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 2 - Amidonniers / Compans-Caffarelli / Brouardel
- Description: I propose planting a double row of tall-stem trees on both sides of Debat Ponsan Avenue. This excessively wide and impermeable artery is not green at all. This environmental and urban measure aims to ensure greater comfort of use for pedestrians. Desired spacing between each tree: 8 to 10 meters, respecting private access. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A row of trees (17 ground plantings) can be planted on the odd-numbered side of Debat Ponsan Street. The even-numbered side is affected by a gas network running from north to south of the road, requiring a network diversion beforehand, an operation incompatible with the deadlines/budget associated with this participatory budget. Note, this planting project would eliminate about 17 parking spaces. On the occasion of this redevelopment, the implementation of a bicycle lane on the even-numbered side can also be studied. Finally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green this street. This initiative, after agreement from the concerned owners, is subject to technical feasibility conditions: no underground networks, no cellars or crawl spaces, and pedestrian continuity to be respected. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the technical services of the city hall and the metropolis, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to the total budget, and the distribution of votes among competing projects. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Tree-lined Debat Ponsan Avenue"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 2 has shown moderate voter engagement with projects like ""Motion sensor night lighting"" receiving 189 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of active participation.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨204,000, the project is expensive, which could limit its funding chances if the budget becomes constrained.
3. **Project Theme:** Urban greening projects have varied in popularity, but generally, they receive a moderate number of votes. Projects with similar themes in other districts received votes ranging from 37 to 105.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects in the same district have not been among the top vote-getters, suggesting a potential middle-range performance for this project.
5. **Community Impact:** The project proposes significant environmental and urban improvements, which could appeal to environmentally conscious voters.
6. **Visibility and Scope:** The project's impact on parking and inclusion of a bike lane study might polarize voters, impacting its overall appeal.
7. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes, but this also increases competition.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Fun journey on urban nature in the Carmes/Malep√®re/Marcaissonne district
- Cost: 50000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 12 - Pont des Demoiselles / Ormeau / Montaudran / La Terrasse / Malep√®re
- Description: A strength of the Malep√®re / Carmes district is the significant presence of wooded areas, yet they are little known to residents. The creation of a permanent fun trail with panels on biodiversity/nature would help to unveil these spaces. The trail would connect the Bois de l'Hers, the Marcaissonne, the wooded areas along Chemin des Carmes and Malepere, the future urban farm, and the upcoming apiaries. Cost: difficult to estimate with our knowledge. 50,000 euros? üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: In this district, there are numerous wooded and green spaces that are of interest for biodiversity. Installing dedicated panels to raise awareness among users about the preservation of biodiversity, as well as respect for vegetation and public spaces in general, meets the needs. It would involve designing (drawings, graphic palettes, etc.) various panels that would discuss biodiversity and the practices to adopt to preserve the environment. Cost: Graphic design involving an illustrator, manufacturing, and installation of several panels in the green spaces.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Fun journey on urban nature in the Carmes/Malep√®re/Marcaissonne district, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Fun journey on urban nature in the Carmes/Malep√®re/Marcaissonne district"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 12 has shown strong voter engagement and support for ecological projects, as seen with the high votes for the Bike lane on Saint-Exup√©ry Avenue and Mosquito Control.
2. **Project Theme and Relevance:** The project focuses on enhancing biodiversity and public awareness, aligning well with current environmental concerns, which could attract a significant number of votes.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in the district, like the Installation of a fitness trail, received moderate support (76 votes, Ranking: 49). This suggests a decent baseline interest in ecological and recreational enhancements.
4. **Cost Efficiency:** At ‚Ç¨50,000, the project is relatively affordable compared to other high-ranking projects, potentially allowing it to be funded even if it doesn't top the vote count.
5. **Project Visibility and Appeal:** Assuming effective communication and community engagement, the project's focus on fun and education could broaden its appeal.
6. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, there's potential for more votes overall, which might dilute the impact of highly committed voter groups unless this project captures widespread attention.
7. **Estimated Voting Range:** Based on similar projects and district voting patterns, it's reasonable to expect this project to attract votes in the lower to mid-range of the district's historical data.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with historically higher engagement or those addressing widely felt issues tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Installation of Public Toilets at Parc de Gironis"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 14 has shown moderate engagement in past elections, with projects receiving a range of votes but generally not exceeding 85 votes.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨70,000, the cost is moderate and comparable to other projects in the district that have received a decent number of votes.
3. **Project Utility and Appeal:** The project addresses a basic need (sanitation), which is likely to have broad appeal, especially in a park setting.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar utility projects (like public toilets in other districts) have not garnered high votes, suggesting a potential ceiling on interest levels.
5. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, there might be a slight increase in votes for all projects, but this does not necessarily translate to a top ranking due to the competitive nature of more appealing projects.
6. **Social and Ecological Relevance:** The project aligns with ecological and health priorities, which could enhance its appeal given current social trends.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it is feasible to fund this project if it ranks reasonably well.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Secure Atlanta Avenue with lighting for pedestrians and bicycles (from the section between Columbus dead-end and LIDL, approximately 500m), listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated in descending order of popularity until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to a broad audience, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects. District-specific voting trends and the average number of votes per project also play a crucial role.

**Analysis of the Project ""Secure Atlanta Avenue with lighting for pedestrians and bicycles"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 10 had a moderate average vote count in 2022, with projects like a sports complex and park renovation receiving substantial support (205 and 134 votes respectively). This suggests a community interest in infrastructural and safety improvements.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is relatively expensive, which could limit its funding chances if there are many other popular but less costly projects.
3. **Project Theme and Relevance:** The project addresses safety and infrastructure, similar to other well-supported projects in Toulouse, indicating potential high voter interest.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in other districts, focusing on pedestrian and bicycle safety, received a decent number of votes (ranging from 50 to 206 votes), suggesting a consistent voter interest in such themes.
5. **Expected Higher Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, there might be a proportional increase in votes for all projects, potentially affecting the absolute number of votes this project might receive.
6. **Visibility and Urgency:** The description highlights a clear and present need for lighting, which could resonate well with daily commuters and local residents, potentially increasing its appeal.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of this project, its approval will depend significantly on the cost and popularity of competing projects.

284;57;128;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget. District-specific voting trends and the average number of votes per project also play crucial roles in determining which projects are likely to be funded.

**Analysis of the Project ""Replant trees in the Place de l'Arm√©e d'Afrique"":**
1. **District Voting Trends:** District 9 historically has lower voter engagement and average votes per project compared to more central districts. The highest voted project in this district in 2022 received 111 votes.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨30,000, the project is relatively affordable, which could allow it to be funded even if it doesn't receive a very high number of votes.
3. **Project Theme:** Greening and environmental projects have a mixed record, with some receiving substantial support while others do not perform as well. This project's success might hinge on local residents' perceived value of the green space.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects across the city have received a wide range of votes, suggesting variability based on local preferences and project specifics.
5. **Potential Voter Increase:** With an expected higher turnout, there might be a slight increase in votes for all projects, but this does not necessarily translate to a proportionate increase for this specific project.
6. **Project Visibility and Appeal:** The project's success will depend on effective campaigning and the residents' connection to the specific area being redeveloped.
7. **Historical Data from Similar Projects:** Projects in the same district with similar budgets have not ranked very high, suggesting a moderate performance for this project.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: More bike racks at the Saint-Cyprien library
- Cost: 800.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 6 - Saint-Cyprien
- Description: There is a bike rack in front of the Saint-Cyprien library, but it is very insufficient and there is not enough space for bikes to park. Often, people are forced to lock their bikes to the children's playground fence or the building's emergency staircase. Therefore, an additional bike rack is needed. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Urban furniture such as bike racks cannot be installed directly in front of the Saint-Cyprien library in continuation of the existing one along the facade or in front of the playground for the following reasons: the dedicated areas are too insufficient as they are needed for containers, for the movement of emergency vehicles, and also for pedestrians. The Charles de Fitte alleys offer bike stands about 30 meters from the library entrance. However, additional installations can be added at the corner of R√©clusane Street and Charles de Fitte alleys (about 70 meters from the library entrance), subject to the presence of underground networks.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Greening and beautification of the cemetery wall on Avenue de la Colonne
- Cost: 150000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 4 - Lapujade / Bonnefoy / P√©riole / Marengo / La Colonne
- Description: Greening of the planters along the cemetery on Avenue de la Colonne with heat-tolerant, low-maintenance perennial plants. The goals are both ecological and aesthetic:
- Increase biodiversity
- Add more greenery and color to the avenue
- Contribute to the fight against climate change
üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal would be to remove the planters and create pits to plant climbers (similar to the ""flowers on my wall"" initiative). Indeed, planting in pits will ensure better longevity for the plants. However, this proposal will be feasible only after a diagnostic of the cemetery wall's structure confirms the possibility of removing the planters and creating the pits. Moreover, the continuity of the plantings cannot be maintained along the entire length of this wall in order to monitor the wall's condition. On the un-planted sections, a mural with a vegetation theme could be interspersed between two plantings, allowing for visual continuity.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Greening and beautification of the cemetery wall on Avenue de la Colonne, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Greening and beautification of the cemetery wall on Avenue de la Colonne"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 4 had a moderate average vote count in 2022, with projects receiving between 7 to 115 votes. This suggests a mid-level engagement compared to other districts.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨150,000, the project is moderately expensive, which could be a limiting factor given the total budget constraints and competition from other projects.
3. **Project Theme:** Greening projects have varied in popularity, but generally, those with ecological and aesthetic benefits, like this one, align well with contemporary urban priorities.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects across the city received a wide range of votes, suggesting that success can be variable and is likely influenced by specific project details and local demographics.
5. **Previous Similar Projects in the District:** The most similar project in the district last year, ""Greening the surroundings of the Marengo-P√©riole schools,"" received only 20 votes, indicating potential challenges for greening projects in this area to attract high voter turnout.
6. **Project Visibility and Appeal:** The project's focus on biodiversity and climate change is likely to resonate well with environmentally conscious voters, potentially increasing its appeal.
7. **Expected Higher Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes than similar projects in the previous year, but this also means more competition.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Drinking fountain at Place Sainte-Scarbes
- Cost: 10000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 1 - Capitole / Arnaud Bernard / Carmes
- Description: At least one tree, one bench, and one drinking fountain on each square. Whether in open soil or in pots, depending on the constraints of Historical Monuments, underground networks, and traffic, envisioning a tree from square to small square: Trinit√©, Rouaix, Perchepinte, Montoulieu, Stes-Scarbes, Boulbonne, St-Julien, and others with forgotten names: St-Barth√©lemy (Languedoc/Nazareth), Visitation (R√©musat/P√©rigord), 3 pillars (3 pillars/St-Charles/Gatien-Arnoult), Pouzonville (St-Charles/Pouzonville/Merly), with fixed bench and drinking fountain, roughly every 100 meters. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal to install a tree, a bench, and a fountain on each square cannot be accepted within the framework of this call for ideas. Some of the locations mentioned in the proposal have already undergone urban developments (some are completed, others are under study). Such projects are part of a broader requalification project (exceeding the amount allocated to the participatory budget), in order not to burden future projects. - Places de la Trinit√©, Rouaix, Boulbonne: these squares are already qualitatively developed. Drinking fountains are present in the nearby vicinity (between 70m to 250m). The limited free space, pedestrian continuities, emergency access, and existing underground networks do not allow for the installation of a tree and additional urban furniture. - Places Montoulieu, Perchepinte, St-Julien, St-Barth√©lemy (Languedoc/Nazareth): on these sites, so as not to burden a global project, the installation of a tree, a fountain, and a bench will need to be integrated into a global project (example Place Mage) or soon at Place du Parlement. - Rue des 3 pillars (3 pillars/St-Charles/Gatien-Arnoult): 2 trees will be planted as part of the Toulouse center project in the Arnaud Bernard district, along with chair-type furniture. - Rue Pouzonville (St-Charles/Pouzonville/Merly)/ rue de la Visitation (R√©musat/P√©rigord): the installation of a tree, a fountain, and a bench is compromised due to networks, terrace footprints, camera poles, pedestrian continuities. The limited free space does not allow for a favorable response to this request. Nevertheless, at Place Saintes-Scarbes, a drinking fountain can be installed subject to the presence of networks and the favorable opinion of the Architecte des B√¢timents de France. The installation of trees seems difficult, however, due to the proximity of the metro tunnel nearby.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Drinking fountain at Place Sainte-Scarbes, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Drinking fountain at Place Sainte-Scarbes"":**
1. **District Voting History:** The project is in District 1, which historically sees high voter turnout and engagement, with projects like ""Greening of the Place du Capitole"" receiving substantial votes.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨10,000, the project is relatively low-cost, which could allow it to be easily funded within the budget constraints.
3. **Project Theme:** Urban greening and public amenities have been popular, as seen with similar projects in the same district.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar low-cost projects in the district received a moderate number of votes (e.g., ""Bike inflation stations"" with 74 votes).
5. **Potential Voter Base:** The project might attract voters interested in urban beautification and practical amenities, but it lacks the broader appeal of larger greening projects.
6. **Constraints and Limitations:** The project description notes some limitations due to urban planning and existing developments, which might reduce its appeal.
7. **Expected Increase in Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes, but so will other projects, possibly diluting its impact.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Educational sound radar on All√©e de Brienne
- Cost: 31500.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 2 - Amidonniers / Compans-Caffarelli / Brouardel
- Description: The noise from vehicles rolling on the pavement depends on: 1 - The pavement itself (type and condition of the surface). 2 - The speed of the vehicles. 3 - The eccentricities of some users, motorcycles/cars that wake up the residents of the entire neighborhood in the middle of the night. The urgent actions to be taken are: The repair of the pavement on the All√©e with a noise-reducing surface. The installation of acoustic sensors associated with surveillance cameras planned for 2024. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Within the framework of this participatory budget and the associated deadlines and budget, it is not feasible to proceed with the replacement of the pavement surface. However, it is possible to install an educational radar which, with the help of a luminous panel, indicates to the driver whether the noise level of their motor vehicle is compliant or not.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widely felt issues tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of the Project ""Educational sound radar on All√©e de Brienne"":**
1. **District Voting History:** The district of Amidonniers / Compans-Caffarelli / Brouardel has shown moderate voter engagement with an average vote count of 58.2 per project in 2022.
2. **Cost and Budget Impact:** The project cost (‚Ç¨31,500) is moderate and feasible within the total budget, making it more likely to be funded once it crosses a reasonable vote threshold.
3. **Theme Relevance:** Noise control is a recurring theme in the district, indicating community concern. Previous similar projects like ""Noise and speed radars on the Barcelona Alley/Twin Bridges"" received 50 votes.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in the district and city have shown varied interest, with votes ranging from 22 to 189. This project's innovative approach (educational radar) might attract more attention than simple speed controls.
5. **Expected Increased Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, projects might generally receive more votes, but competition will also increase.
6. **Project Visibility and Appeal:** The project's focus on educational and preventive measures rather than punitive might appeal to a broader audience, potentially increasing its vote count.
7. **Historical Data from Similar Projects:** Projects with a focus on community improvement and moderate costs tend to perform moderately well, suggesting this project could attract a significant number of votes but might not be among the very top vote-getters due to its specific focus.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Revegetation of Aym√© Kunc Square
- Cost: 10000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 1 - Capitole / Arnaud Bernard / Carmes
- Description: Over the years, the Aym√© Kunc square has lost much of its vegetation due to storms or drought. Just this year, three trees have died (including a young tree that was planted last year and did not survive the heat of this summer). This square deserves to have the dead trees replaced with species adapted to climate change. It also needs replanting of the many other dead shrubs that have never been replaced. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It is proposed to replant 4/5 trees, about twenty shrubs, and also climbing plants on some grilles. In addition, there are plans to replenish the lawn, refurbish the street furniture (benches/trash bins), and possibly add some hardy flowering perennials.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project

237;53;135;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Fitness Trail
- Cost: 20000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 18 - Lardenne / Pradettes / Basso-Cambo
- Description: Develop the public garden next to the Ehpad Fran√ßoise de Veyrinas. I suggest that we create a small sports health trail next to the playground. The residents, especially seniors, will be able to improve their lifestyle by engaging in physical activity. This fitness trail can include several installations: elliptical bike, back bars... üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Install modules such as stretching or cardio-training adapted for the Senior public in addition to the existing facilities. The site for installation is to be determined, as the space of the playground is too constrained for this equipment.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Fitness Trail, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Fitness Trail Project:**
1. **District Voting History:** District 18 has shown moderate voter engagement with projects like the health trail at Moun√®de Park receiving 80 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of interest in community and health-related projects.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨20,000, the Fitness Trail is relatively affordable, which could allow it to be easily funded within the budget constraints.
3. **Similar Projects:** Similar projects in the same district and city have received a moderate number of votes, indicating a consistent but not overwhelming interest in fitness and health trails.
4. **Community Impact:** The project targets seniors, a demographic likely to appreciate nearby recreational facilities, potentially boosting its appeal.
5. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** The project's cost and focus are similar to the previously moderately successful health trail in the same district, suggesting it might attract a similar level of support.
6. **Economic and Social Relevance:** Given the growing awareness and emphasis on health, especially post-pandemic, projects promoting physical activity might see increased popularity.
7. **Visibility and Promotion:** The success will also depend on how well the project is promoted during the campaigning period.

310;53;136;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Create a cycle link from Rond point Pugens to Chemin de Firmis
- Cost: 40000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 11 - Bonhoure / Guilhem√©ry / Ch√¢teau de l'Hers / Limayrac / C√¥te Pav√©e
- Description: The path of Firmis, frequented by many walkers and cyclists, has just been redeveloped in its upper part. A wild connection (acrobatic for cycles and strollers) has spontaneously formed along the Limayrac municipal hall to reach the Pugens roundabout. It would be appropriate to develop it to make this heavily used direct route passable, which requires removing only one or two spaces from the adjacent parking lot. This development is very short (less than 100 m). WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: This idea to develop what is commonly called a ""goat path"" is feasible.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Strolling down Jean Mermoz Street, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its cost relative to the budget, and its alignment with prevalent community needs and values. District-specific voting patterns and the average number of votes per project also play crucial roles.

**Analysis of ""Strolling down Jean Mermoz Street"":**
1. **District Voting Patterns:** District 16 historically has lower voting engagement and average votes per project, suggesting a potentially lower vote count for projects in this area.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is relatively expensive, which could hinder its funding chances if the budget becomes constrained before it reaches this project in the ranking.
3. **Project Theme:** The project focuses on combating heat islands and enhancing urban greenery, which aligns with popular themes in other districts but has shown mixed results in District 16.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects in the same district received moderate to low support, such as ""Planting vegetation to limit summer overheating..."" with 96 votes.
5. **Increased Voter Turnout:** While a higher turnout is expected, which could increase the total votes, it might not proportionally benefit this specific project given the district's historical voting patterns.
6. **Project Visibility and Appeal:** The project's success will depend significantly on its visibility and how well it is marketed to the electorate, especially in a district with generally lower engagement.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the high cost, even with a moderate number of votes, it might be skipped if earlier projects deplete the available funds.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects.

**Analysis of the Project ""Inclusive playground at Dortis path"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 7 has shown moderate voting activity with projects receiving up to 61 votes, suggesting a decent level of community engagement but not the highest in the city.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨233,500, this project is relatively expensive, which could be a disadvantage as it consumes a significant portion of the budget, potentially affecting its chances of being funded if there are many other popular but less expensive projects.
3. **Project Appeal:** The project targets inclusivity and children, likely appealing to families and educators, potentially increasing its vote count.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in other districts have not garnered a high number of votes, indicating that while the theme is appealing, it may not be a top priority for voters.
5. **Increased Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes than similar projects in the past, but this also means more competition.
6. **Social Relevance:** The project's proximity to a new school and a mother-child reception center increases its relevance, potentially boosting voter interest.
7. **Historical Data from Similar Projects:** Projects with similar themes and costs in the same district have not ranked in the top 50, suggesting that while the project is socially valuable, it may not compete well against others with broader appeal or lower costs.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Create pedestrian connections to the Cr√™tes parking lot
- Cost: 40000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 10 - Jolimont / Soupetard / Roseraie / Gloire / Gramont / Amouroux
- Description: The Cr√™tes parking lot is today exclusively reserved for vehicle parking; however, this area sees a significant daily flow of pedestrians crossing the parking lot and weaving between vehicles to reach the subway via the pedestrian crossing located on Avenue Yves Brunaud. The idea would be to create a pedestrian continuity within the parking lot to connect the crosswalks located on either side while reintroducing vegetation to the space that is currently exclusively paved. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is acceptable regarding the creation of pedestrian connections, but it is likely that the re-vegetation cannot be carried out in view of the Express Bike Network project.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

6. **Expected Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes, but competition will also increase.
7. **Project Visibility and Appeal:** Assuming effective communication and relevance to daily commuter issues, the project should resonate well with local voters.

369;50;140;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the district, and the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits.

**Analysis of the project ""Creation of a city stadium at La Reynerie"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 17 has historically shown low voter engagement and support for projects, with the highest voted project in 2022 receiving only 33 votes.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨150,000, the project is moderately expensive, which could be a significant factor given the limited budget and previous voting patterns in the district.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar sports and recreational projects in other districts have received a mixed response, suggesting that success can vary significantly based on local interests and project specifics.
4. **Socio-economic Factors:** District 17 may have different priorities or less engagement in participatory budgeting, which could affect the voting turnout for this project.
5. **Project Appeal:** The project aims to transform a gravel lot into a multi-sport field, which could be appealing as it promotes sports and community activities, potentially increasing its votes.
6. **Visibility and Awareness:** The project's success will heavily depend on how well it is marketed and the community's awareness of its benefits.
7. **Competition with Other Projects:** With 8 projects submitted in the district for this election cycle, competition could either dilute the vote across multiple projects or concentrate it on a few appealing ones.

Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Educational sound radar on the alleys of Barcelona, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, relevance to community needs, and cost-effectiveness. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing widespread concerns tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Educational sound radar on the alleys of Barcelona"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 2 has a moderate average vote count (58.2), suggesting a decent level of voter engagement but not the highest in the city.
2. **Cost and Budget Impact:** The project cost (‚Ç¨31,500) is relatively low, enhancing its chances of being funded after higher-cost projects are considered.
3. **Previous Similar Projects:** Similar projects like ""Noise and speed radars on the Barcelona Alley/Twin Bridges"" received 50 votes, indicating a moderate interest in noise control initiatives in this district.
4. **Project Relevance:** The project addresses a specific and relatable issue (noise pollution), which could appeal to local residents affected by this problem.
5. **Comparison with Other Projects:** The project's cost and theme are similar to other moderately successful projects, suggesting it might not be a top contender but could still perform reasonably well.
6. **Expected Voter Turnout and Engagement:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might gain more votes if it resonates well with the community's current concerns.
7. **Ranking Estimation:** Given the moderate success of similar projects and the project's relevance, it is likely to rank in the middle range but not among the top due to stiff competition from projects with broader appeal or lower costs.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Jacobins/Fermat district: limit traffic and speed with road markings.
- Cost: 4000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 1 - Capitole / Arnaud Bernard / Carmes
- Description: Jacobins Convent District / Fermat High Schools: Limit traffic and speed on Lakanal Street (and similar streets) to 10 km/h through the use of speed bumps. The aim is to:
- increase the safety of schoolchildren, high school students, passersby, and tourists
- reduce air pollution for residents
- reduce noise pollution for residents
üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The installation of speed bumps on these roads is not feasible as it is incompatible with the movement of people with reduced mobility. Indeed, since this street is in a meeting zone (limited to 20km/h), it must allow gentle traffic on the roadway, especially for people with reduced mobility, given that the sidewalks are narrow. Note that a comprehensive redevelopment project for Lakanal Street and Maurice Prin Alley is currently under study. Moreover, this area should become more tranquil once the access control at the intersection of Anatole France Square and Deville Street is operational (a coordinated installation as part of the Lois-R√©musat sector calming project). Finally, it should be noted that this street is equipped with chicane parking to reduce speed. Nevertheless, it is proposed to reinforce the road markings with pedestrian logos suitable for meeting zones.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to a wide audience, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or projects addressing widespread concerns tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of the Project ""Jacobins/Fermat district: limit traffic and speed with road markings""**
1. **District Voting History**: The project is in District 1, which historically has high voter turnout and engagement, as evidenced by high average votes per project (136.9).
2. **Cost Efficiency**: The project's low cost (‚Ç¨4,000) makes it an attractive option as it allows for the possibility of funding multiple projects without exhausting the budget quickly.
3. **Relevance and Public Interest**: The project addresses traffic and safety, which are common concerns, likely increasing its appeal.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar traffic and safety projects have received moderate to high votes, suggesting a consistent interest in such initiatives.
5. **Project Visibility and Scope**: The project's focus on a specific area (Jacobins/Fermat) might limit its appeal compared to city-wide initiatives but is still significant within the district.
6. **Potential Controversy**: The project notes that speed bumps are not feasible, which might reduce its attractiveness to those strongly desiring significant traffic calming measures.
7. **Competition with Other Projects**: Being one of 10 projects in the district, it faces competition, but its low cost and high relevance might give it an edge.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Greening of the Bourrassol Parking Lot
- Cost: 250000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 6 - Saint-Cyprien
- Description: White paint and green bollards mark car parking spaces on several streets in the Bourrassol neighborhood, but these are underused and aesthetically lacking areas. It would be far more beneficial to take advantage of these zones to remove the asphalt, restore access to the soil, and sow wildflowers and other small local species. This would enhance biodiversity, combat heat islands, and bring more beauty to the neighborhood. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A de-asphalting project could be implemented in the existing parking area at the entrance of the street. Trees and flowers could be planted in the parking area at the back of the lot, continuing those existing in the playground area, and would create a vegetated open space set back from the road. This project could eliminate about 19 parking spaces. The remaining parking spaces along Bourrassol street, totaling 27 (including 2 for disabled access and 2 reserved for electric vehicle charging), could be de-asphalted and covered with grassy honeycomb slabs, grassed paving stones, etc. The proposal for greening is not retained for the streets of the Bourrassol neighborhood because this project would be too extensive (the parking spaces being simply marked on the road, are not protected), within the framework of the budget allocated to the participatory budget, and the trees would represent an obstacle on the roadway.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Greening of the Bourrassol Parking Lot, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm that prioritizes projects in descending order of votes until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to the total budget, and the distribution of votes among competing projects.

**Analysis of the Project ""Greening of the Bourrassol Parking Lot"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 6 - Saint-Cyprien has shown strong support for greening and urban improvement projects, as evidenced by the high votes for similar projects in the past.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is relatively expensive, which might limit its ability to be funded if the budget is constrained, especially given the higher number of competing projects this year.
3. **Theme Popularity:** Greening projects have been moderately popular across the city, but not always top-ranked, suggesting a solid but not overwhelming voter base.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in the same district have received a decent number of votes (ranging from 76 to 206 votes), indicating a likely favorable reception.
5. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of this project, it's crucial to consider that several smaller or similarly priced projects could be favored if they garner slightly more votes.
6. **Increased Turnout:** With a higher voter turnout expected, the project might receive more votes than similar projects in previous years, but this also means more votes spread across more projects.
7. **Project Appeal and Relevance:** The project's focus on enhancing biodiversity and combating heat islands aligns well with current urban environmental concerns, potentially increasing its appeal.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Installation of dry toilets in Place des Tibaous"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 14 has a moderate voting engagement with an average of 40.4 votes per project, which is lower than the city's more active districts.
2. **Cost Comparison:** The project cost (‚Ç¨70,000) is moderate and aligns with other similar projects that have received a decent number of votes, suggesting it's not prohibitively expensive.
3. **Project Relevance:** The project addresses a practical need for public toilets during events, which could be seen as a high utility addition by local residents.
4. **Previous Similar Projects:** Similar utility projects like public toilets in other districts have garnered a modest number of votes, indicating a consistent but limited voter interest in such amenities.
5. **Competition Within District:** The project will compete against 9 other projects in the same district, and its success will partly depend on the nature and appeal of these competing projects.
6. **Historical Data from Similar Projects:** The greening project at the same location (Place des Tibaous) received 44 votes, suggesting moderate interest in developments at this location.
7. **Expected Turnout Increase:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes than similar projects in previous years, but this will also depend on the overall increase in voter participation across all projects.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Greening of the corner of Louis Vitet Street and Joseph Roques Street, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Greening of the corner of Louis Vitet Street and Joseph Roques Street"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 12 has shown strong voter support for projects, as evidenced by the high votes for the bike lane project and reasonable support for other green initiatives.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨25,000, the project is relatively affordable, which could allow it to be easily funded within the budget constraints, assuming similar budget allocations as in 2022.
3. **Theme Popularity:** Greening projects have varied in popularity, but the moderate cost and practical benefits of this project (shade and biodiversity) could appeal broadly to the community.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects in other districts received a moderate number of votes, suggesting a baseline interest in such initiatives.
5. **Project Specifics and Location:** The project does not require disruptive construction, which might increase its appeal. Its location at a specific intersection could either limit or concentrate local support.
6. **Expected Voter Turnout and Project Competition:** With an increased voter turnout and 183 projects in the upcoming election, competition will be stiff. However, the project's modest scope paired with a relevant ecological theme might stand out.
7. **Historical Data from Similar Projects:** Projects like the ""Green"" Restructuring of Roger Arnaud Square in the same district received a decent number of votes, indicating potential support for similar new projects.

280;47;147;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget. District-specific voting patterns and the average number of votes per project in each district also play crucial roles.

**Analysis of ""More trash cans and ashtrays on the Maourine square""**
1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The project's low cost (‚Ç¨1500) makes it highly feasible within the budget constraints, allowing it to be funded even after higher-cost projects.
2. **District Voting Patterns**: District 9 had an average vote count of 32.9 per project in 2022, which is relatively low compared to other districts. This suggests a moderate level of voter engagement.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar small-scale environmental projects in other districts received a modest number of votes, indicating a consistent but limited voter interest in such initiatives.
4. **Project Appeal**: The project addresses a practical and visible need (cleanliness and utility), which could appeal to daily users of the space, potentially increasing its vote count.
5. **Historical Data from District 9**: The most voted project in this district in 2022 received 111 votes. Given the modest scale and impact of the proposed project, it is unlikely to exceed this.
6. **Expected Voter Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive slightly more votes than similar projects in the past, but likely not enough to place it in the top ranks.
7. **Competition**: With 183 projects proposed in the upcoming election, the competition for votes will be intense, possibly diluting the vote share for any single project.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Refurbishment of the pathways in Biscotte Park, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Toulouse's Participatory Budgeting**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, who can vote for up to three projects. The total budget is allocated using a greedy algorithm, funding the most popular projects first until the budget is exhausted. Factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its cost relative to the budget, and its distribution across different city districts.

**Analysis of the Project: Refurbishment of the Pathways in Biscotte Park**

1. **District Voting Patterns**: District 16 historically has lower voter engagement and support for projects, with average votes per project around 39.2, which is below the city average.
   
2. **Project Cost**: At ‚Ç¨250,000, this project is relatively expensive, which could hinder its ability to be funded within the budget constraints, especially in a district with lower voting turnout.

3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar infrastructure projects in other districts with higher engagement or lower costs have received more votes. For instance, projects in District 6 and 10 with costs around ‚Ç¨175,000 and ‚Ç¨200,000 received 206 and 134 votes respectively.

4. **Historical Data from District 16**: The most supported project in 2022 in this district received 96 votes, suggesting a ceiling for potential votes under normal circumstances.

5. **Project Appeal**: The project addresses a practical need (repairing and improving pathways), which could appeal to regular park users and those concerned with urban mobility and accessibility.

6. **Increased Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, there might be a slight increase in votes, but this might not proportionally benefit a high-cost project in a less engaged district.

7. **Budget Allocation Strategy**: Given the project's high cost and the typical voting patterns in District 16, it is less likely to be funded if there are several other popular projects with lower costs.

8. **Top Rankings Likelihood**: Considering the high cost and average district engagement, it is unlikely that this project will make it into the top 5 or even top 10 unless there is an unexpected surge in district-wide voter turnout and support.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Greening of the sidewalk at the corner of Avenue de Muret and Rue Axel Duboul
- Cost: 60000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 15 - Croix de Pierre / Route d'Espagne
- Description: In front of L√©onidas and the greengrocer, there is a large tarred area that is lifeless. I suggest transforming this small square by planting flowers directly in the ground instead of in pots (to avoid watering too often), and by adding benches to make the place more welcoming and attractive for the merchants. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Removal of the tarred surfaces in favor of shrubby plants, and creation of a resting area with the installation of benches.

Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Greening of the sidewalk at the corner of Avenue de Muret and Rue Axel Duboul, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of votes among competing projects within the same district or thematic area.

**Analysis of the Project ""Greening of the sidewalk at the corner of Avenue de Muret and Rue Axel Duboul"":**
1. **District Voting History:** The district of Croix de Pierre / Route d'Espagne has shown moderate interest in greening projects, with a similar project receiving 79 votes in the previous year.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨60,000, the project is moderately priced, which could make it more likely to be funded after higher-voted but more expensive projects are passed over due to budget constraints.
3. **Theme Popularity:** Greening projects have been moderately popular across Toulouse, suggesting a consistent but not overwhelming voter interest.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in other districts have received a range of votes, often correlating with the project's visibility and the district's demographic engagement.
5. **Expected Increased Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes than similar projects in the previous year, but this will also depend on the competition within the district.
6. **Project Appeal and Utility:** The project's focus on enhancing a community space could appeal to local residents who frequent the area, potentially increasing its vote count.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it is feasible for this project to be funded if it ranks sufficiently high in votes.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Create bicycle parking spaces on Rue R√©clusane
- Cost: 250.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 6 - Saint-Cyprien
- Description: R√©clusane Street has too few parking spaces for bicycles, especially near Armand Duportal School. Cyclists park on the barriers in front of the school, leaving little room for pedestrians to pass. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal to install bicycle racks near Armand Duportal School has not been accepted because, as part of the redevelopment and requalification of R√©clusane Street from the sidewalk in the summer of 2023, several bicycle racks have been installed on the sidewalk opposite the school and at the entrance of Dames de la Porte alley and R√©clusane Street. However, the addition of one or two bicycle racks will be considered in continuation of those installed opposite the school, on R√©clusane Street.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widespread issues tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of ""Create bicycle parking spaces on Rue R√©clusane"":**

2. **District Voting History**: District 6 - Saint-Cyprien has shown strong support for urban development and greening projects, with relatively high average votes per project compared to other districts.
3. **Project Theme**: Bicycle-related projects have historically performed well, as seen with the top-ranking projects from the previous year. This suggests a strong community interest in cycling infrastructure.
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Similar projects in the district, like the pedestrian redevelopment and greening project, received substantial votes (206 votes), indicating a supportive voting base for this type of initiative.
5. **Project Necessity and Visibility**: The project addresses a specific need at a known location near a school, which could increase its visibility and perceived importance among local voters.
6. **Overall Voter Engagement**: With an expected higher turnout and the project's relevance and low cost, it is likely to attract a significant number of votes.
7. **Competition**: Given the number of projects in the district (9 this year), competition is moderate but the project's specific focus and low cost provide a competitive edge.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Rehabilitate Raspail Square
- Cost: 50000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 11 - Bonhoure / Guilhem√©ry / Ch√¢teau de l'Hers / Limayrac / C√¥te Pav√©e
- Description: Raspail Square could have a lot of charm but currently lacks attractiveness due to very poor facilities. Therefore, I propose making it one of the key points for local interaction by installing some basic structures: workout bars, a book-sharing box, compost bins, chess/checkers tables, etc. A fountain could also brighten it up! üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is acceptable except for the provision of a fountain, which would not fit within the maximum budget allocated to each idea of the participatory budget.

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its cost relative to its perceived benefits, and its alignment with prevalent community needs and values. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing more universally appealing issues (like environmental improvements or public safety) tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the project ""Rehabilitate Raspail Square"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 11 has a moderate average vote count (43.6), suggesting a mid-level engagement compared to other districts.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** The project cost (‚Ç¨50,000) is moderate and aligns well with previously successful projects in the same budget range, making it a feasible choice under budget constraints.
3. **Project Appeal:** The project aims to enhance local interaction and community space, which is generally well-received as it benefits a broad demographic.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in terms of theme and cost have received a moderate number of votes (e.g., ""Neighborhood Greening"" with 68 votes).
5. **Project Specifics Exclusion:** The exclusion of the fountain due to budget constraints might slightly reduce the project's appeal but focuses the budget on more practical enhancements.
6. **Increased Voter Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, there could be a proportional increase in votes for all projects, maintaining competitive dynamics similar to previous years.
7. **Visibility and Promotion:** The success might also hinge on how well the project is promoted within the community and its visibility on the voting platform.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Danger: Intersection between Lafayette Street and Rempart Villeneuve Street, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to a wide audience, and its cost relative to its perceived benefits. Projects in districts with higher engagement and average votes tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Danger: Intersection between Lafayette Street and Rempart Villeneuve Street"":**
1. **District Voting History**: The project is in District 1, which has historically high voter engagement and average votes per project.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: The project's low cost (‚Ç¨1000) makes it highly feasible to be funded within the budget constraints, allowing for potentially higher ranking as funds may still be available after more expensive projects are considered.
3. **Relevance and Urgency**: The project addresses a safety concern, which is a high priority and relatable issue for many voters, potentially increasing its appeal.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar safety and infrastructure projects have received moderate to high votes, suggesting a consistent interest in such themes.
5. **Project Visibility and Simplicity**: The straightforward nature of the project (improving signage at a dangerous intersection) is easy for voters to understand and support, possibly enhancing its vote count.
6. **Historical Data from Similar Projects**: Projects with a focus on safety and minor infrastructure improvements in the same district have garnered a significant number of votes, although not always ranking in the top positions.
7. **Expected Increased Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, projects in highly populated or active districts like District 1 might see an increase in total votes.

353;35;154;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Creation of a chess playing area, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its cost relative to the budget, and its relevance to the community needs of the specific district.

**Analysis of the Project ""Creation of a chess playing area"":**
1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The project's cost (‚Ç¨20,000) is relatively low, which could make it more likely to be funded after higher-voted but more expensive projects are considered.
2. **District Voting Trends**: District 15 had a moderate average vote count in the previous election, with the most voted project receiving 125 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of voter engagement.
3. **Project Appeal**: Chess as a community activity might attract a specific but enthusiastic group, potentially increasing its votes.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar low-cost community projects in other districts received relatively low votes, suggesting potential challenges in achieving high vote counts.
5. **Historical Data**: Projects in District 15 had varied success, with the highest-ranking project at 21st position. This sets a precedent but also shows the challenge of breaking into the top ranks.
6. **Project Uniqueness**: The project is unique within its district's offerings, which might reduce direct competition and help it stand out.
7. **Social and Recreational Value**: The project promotes social interaction and outdoor activity, aligning with popular themes in urban community projects.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Implement photoluminescent paint marking on the Coubertin and Garigliano Bridges.
- Cost: 50000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 5 - Saint-Michel / Saint-Agne / Empalot / Le Busca / Ile du Ramier / Monplaisir
- Description: The idea: to create simple graphic compositions on bike paths using photoluminescent paint that stores daylight and reflects it when night falls for a duration of 10 hours. This is to make the bike path visible at night for about ten hours. The main goal is to secure sections of bike paths at night and to make the bike paths attractive and aesthetic. On Pont Coubertin/Garigliano? üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal to create bike paths with photoluminescent paint may be feasible on the Pierre de Coubertin and Garigliano Bridges. However, there are some reservations: A test was conducted on Velasquez Street and the path of La Crabe in Toulouse in 2022, but this application did not meet expectations regarding the duration of luminescence mentioned in the product sheets. Moreover, this product is not approved for ""standard"" use and can only be used in experiments. The main reasons cited are: 1. The photoluminescent property is barely visible in a place that is already poorly lit, which would be the case on these two bridges equipped with street lamps on either side of the road. 2. The duration of the luminescence is far from the announced 10 hours but rather around 3 hours. 3. The lifespan of the luminescence deteriorates over time. Finally, this process seems very costly considering that it does not provide the expected service.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Development of the small Bagatelle grove, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with historically higher engagement or those addressing widespread concerns tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Development of the small Bagatelle grove"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 16 has shown moderate engagement in previous elections, with projects receiving a range of votes but generally not reaching the top ranks.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨20,000, the project is relatively affordable, which could allow it to be funded even if it doesn't receive the highest number of votes.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar small-scale greening projects in other districts have received a modest number of votes, suggesting a moderate level of voter interest.
4. **Community Impact:** The project aims to enhance a local park, which could appeal to nearby residents but might not have city-wide appeal.
5. **Previous District Projects:** The most voted project in this district in the last election received 96 votes, setting a possible upper limit on expected votes for similar projects.
6. **Economic and Social Context:** Given the economic affordability and the social benefit of adding communal spaces, the project aligns well with community-enhancing initiatives.
7. **Visibility and Promotion:** The success of the project could also depend on how well it is promoted during the campaign period.

Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the project ""Setting up tables in Parc des C√®dres"":**
1. **Cost Efficiency**: The project cost (‚Ç¨10,000) is relatively low, which means it could be fully funded even late in the allocation process, increasing its chances of selection.
2. **District Voting History**: District 18 has shown moderate engagement and support for community and green space projects, as seen with the ""Land covered at the level of the boulodrome"" receiving 189 votes.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar low-cost projects in the same district, like ""Installation of game tables at Place des Pradettes"" (‚Ç¨12,000), received only 14 votes, suggesting a potential lower interest in small-scale installations.
4. **Project Appeal**: The project addresses a practical need for more seating in a park, which could appeal to families and regular park users, potentially increasing its vote count.
5. **Voter Turnout and Distribution**: With an expected higher turnout and 183 projects competing, the vote distribution might be wider, possibly diluting the total votes any single project might receive.
6. **Historical Data on Voting**: Projects in the same district with a community or environmental focus generally received moderate to high votes, suggesting a community interest in such enhancements.
7. **Budget Constraints**: Given the total budget and the project's low cost, it's more likely to be funded after higher-cost projects are considered.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Lardenne School Bike Garages, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widely felt issues tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of the Lardenne School Bike Garages Project:**
1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The project cost (‚Ç¨15,000) is relatively low, which means it could be fully funded even late in the allocation process when the budget might be running low.
2. **District Voting History**: District 18 had a moderate average vote count in the previous election, with projects like ""Land covered at the level of the boulodrome"" receiving up to 189 votes. This suggests a decent level of voter engagement.
3. **Similar Project Performance**: A similar project, ""Bike rack installation in Lardenne,"" received only 8 votes last year, indicating potential low interest in bike rack projects in this district.
4. **Theme Relevance**: The project addresses a practical need (bike storage at schools) which could appeal to parents and school staff, potentially increasing its vote count.
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Projects with a focus on cycling infrastructure had varied success across the city, but generally, those with lower costs and specific utility (like school bike racks) did not rank very high.
6. **Increased Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes than similar projects in the previous year, but this does not necessarily imply a top ranking.
7. **Project Visibility and Promotion**: The success might also hinge on how well the project is promoted within the community and its perceived impact compared to other proposals.

238;32;159;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its cost relative to the budget, and its alignment with prevalent community needs and values. Projects in districts with historically higher engagement or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of North Capelles Children's Games:**
1. **District Voting History:** District 18 has shown moderate engagement, with projects like ""Land covered at the level of the boulodrome"" receiving substantial votes (189 votes). This suggests a decent level of voter participation in this district.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨195,000, the project is relatively high-cost, which could be a limiting factor given the total budget constraint and competition from other projects.
3. **Project Theme:** The project addresses a clear need (children's playgrounds), which typically garners community support, especially from families.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects across the city have not garnered high votes, indicating that while the theme is popular, it might not be a top priority compared to other infrastructure or community projects.
5. **Historical Data from Similar Projects in the District:** Projects with a focus on community and green spaces in this district have received moderate to high votes, suggesting that the theme aligns well with local priorities.
6. **Overall Budget and Number of Projects:** With a higher number of projects this year (183) and a similar budget, the competition for funding will be intense, possibly affecting the chances of higher-cost projects.
7. **Expected Voter Turnout Increase:** An expected higher turnout could benefit projects that appeal broadly to community interests, such as children's playgrounds.

297;32;160;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Two-way cycle lane on Rue Falgui√®re
- Cost: 50000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 3 - Les Chalets / Bayard / Belfort / Saint Aubin / Dupuy
- Description: Cycling against the flow of traffic on Rue de la Concorde and Rue Alexandre Falgui√®re is currently very dangerous with oncoming cars that pass dangerously close. There should be a secure bike lane at least in the opposite direction by removing parking on one side of the street. It is also necessary to consider reducing traffic as much as possible to calm the street. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Such an arrangement cannot be implemented on Rue de la Concorde, under this scheme, due to the presence of a terrace set up on the sidewalk (establishment Le Concorde) and prior infrastructure works that are incompatible with the deadlines and costs associated with this participatory budget. For Rue Falgui√®re, a contraflow bike lane can be considered but presents the following constraints:
- necessity to move the recently installed planter, in consultation with the residents, at the corner of Rue Saint-Papoul (interruption of the bike lane continuity);
- interruption of the bike lane arrangement at the intersection with Rue de la Concorde (narrowing of the lane at the level of the small square);
- arrangement can only be made after the intersection with Rue Saint-Henri, the 2 lanes on the side of Place Roquelaine must be preserved as part of the project for a green square on the square;
- removal of about twenty parking spaces.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widespread concerns tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Two-way cycle lane on Rue Falgui√®re:**
1. **District Voting History:** District 3 has shown moderate voter engagement with an average vote count of 52.4 per project in 2022. Projects related to cycling and greening have performed relatively well.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** The project cost (‚Ç¨50,000) is moderate and more likely to be funded compared to higher-cost projects, given the total budget constraints.
3. **Theme Popularity:** Cycling infrastructure projects have been popular across Toulouse, as seen in similar projects in other districts, suggesting a general positive sentiment towards improving cycling conditions.
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Similar projects in other districts with costs around ‚Ç¨50,000 received votes ranging from 43 to 67, indicating a potential voting range for this project.
5. **Project Constraints:** The project has some logistical constraints that might affect voter perception negatively, such as the interruption of the bike lane and the removal of parking spaces.
6. **Previous District Projects:** The most voted projects in District 3 in 2022 had votes around 95, 94, and 83, suggesting that a well-received project in this district can attract significant voter attention.
7. **Increased Turnout Expectation:** With an expected higher turnout, there might be a slight increase in votes for all projects, potentially benefiting this project if it resonates well with the community.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Adorning the central reservations on Rue Henri Barbusse, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the available budget. Projects in districts with higher average votes and those addressing widespread concerns like greening and transportation tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Adorning the central reservations on Rue Henri Barbusse"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 15 has shown moderate voting activity with projects like ""Greening Croix de Pierre"" receiving 79 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of community engagement but not the highest in the city.
2. **Project Theme and Appeal:** The project focuses on greening and cooling, which are popular themes city-wide, reflecting a strong ecological and quality-of-life appeal.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects in other districts have garnered a range of votes, often around 100-160 votes, suggesting a potential for decent voter support.
4. **Cost Consideration:** At ‚Ç¨110,000, the project is moderately priced, which might make it a feasible choice under budget constraints, especially compared to higher-cost projects.
5. **Expected Higher Turnout:** With an expected higher turnout, there might be a slight increase in votes for all projects, but competition will also be stiffer.
6. **Project Specifics and Location:** The specific focus on cooling down a hot area through greening could resonate well with local voters, especially given increasing awareness of urban heat issues.
7. **Historical Data from Similar Projects:** Projects with a similar budget and theme in the same district have not typically broken into the top 10, suggesting a challenge to reach the very top ranks.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher engagement and those addressing widespread concerns like safety and environmental sustainability tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Securing the greenway at the intersection of Camille Langlade dead-end street"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 15 has shown moderate engagement in past elections, with projects receiving a range of votes but generally not reaching the very top ranks.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨35,000, the project is relatively affordable, which could allow it to be funded even after higher-cost projects have been considered.
3. **Relevance and Urgency:** The project addresses safety for cyclists, a recurring theme in successful projects across the city, suggesting it could resonate well with voters.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar safety and cycling-related projects have received a moderate number of votes, suggesting a consistent but not overwhelming interest.
5. **Project Visibility and Scope:** The project's focus on a specific intersection might limit its appeal compared to more extensive infrastructure projects.
6. **Historical Data from Similar Projects:** Similar projects in the same district have ranked between 69 and 115, indicating a likely position outside the top 50 for this project.
7. **Expected Increase in Voter Turnout:** While an increased turnout could boost votes for all projects, it's unclear if this will significantly alter the project's relative appeal.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the voting history and dynamics within the district. Projects that address widespread concerns or offer significant improvements to public spaces tend to gather more votes.

**Analysis of the Project: Electric islands around the Z√©nith for food trucks and circuses**
1. **District Voting History**: District 19 had a moderate voting engagement in the previous year, with the highest voted project receiving 130 votes. This suggests a reasonable level of voter participation but not exceptionally high.
2. **Project Cost and Appeal**: The project cost (‚Ç¨150,000) is substantial but aligns with costs of other moderately successful projects in the district. The project's ecological and community-friendly appeal (reducing noise and air pollution) is likely to resonate well with environmentally conscious voters.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects focusing on environmental improvements or infrastructure enhancements (like lighting and greening) in the same district received between 37 to 130 votes. This project might attract more interest due to its direct impact on popular events (food trucks, circuses).
4. **Project Visibility and Utility**: The project's utility during events could increase its visibility and the perceived direct benefit to a broader audience, potentially increasing voter interest.
5. **Budget Constraints and Ranking**: Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it's feasible but not guaranteed for funding unless it ranks high enough in votes to be prioritized before the budget cap is reached.
6. **Expected Voter Turnout Increase**: With an expected higher turnout, the project could potentially receive more votes than similar projects in the previous year, assuming increased overall engagement.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

1. **District Voting Trends:** District 14 historically has moderate engagement, with top projects receiving between 26 to 85 votes in 2022.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** The project cost (‚Ç¨35,000) is relatively low, enhancing its feasibility under the budget cap compared to higher-cost projects.
3. **Project Theme Relevance:** The project addresses safety and environmental concerns, which are generally well-received themes, aligning with broader civic interests like reducing pollution and enhancing pedestrian safety.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in terms of theme and district have received moderate support, suggesting a potential for a decent number of votes but not exceptionally high.
5. **Expected Voter Turnout and Project Competition:** With an increased number of projects (183) and possibly higher voter turnout, competition will be stiffer, possibly diluting the vote across more projects.
6. **Historical Data from Similar Projects:** Projects with similar themes in other districts have seen varied success, indicating that while the theme is relevant, its success might heavily depend on local district interest and the specifics of the proposal.
7. **Visibility and Campaigning:** The effectiveness of the project's visibility and campaigning efforts will significantly impact its final vote count.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Bicycle parking on Maurice Sarraut avenues, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to its perceived benefits. Projects in districts with higher engagement and those aligning with popular themes (like sustainability or public infrastructure) tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Bicycle parking on Maurice Sarraut avenues:**
1. **District Voting History:** District 6 - Saint-Cyprien has shown strong support for infrastructure improvements, especially those related to cycling and pedestrian facilities, as evidenced by the high votes for similar projects in the past.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** The project cost (360 ‚Ç¨) is significantly lower than many other projects, making it a highly cost-effective choice, which could appeal to both voters and the selection algorithm.
3. **Theme Popularity:** The focus on cycling infrastructure aligns with a popular theme in Toulouse, as seen with the top-ranking projects from the previous year.
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Similar projects in the same district, like the pedestrian redevelopment and greening project, received substantial support (206 votes), suggesting a favorable reception for related initiatives.
5. **Voter Turnout and Engagement:** With an expected higher turnout and the project's low cost, it stands a good chance of receiving a high number of votes due to minimal financial commitment and high perceived utility.
6. **Project Visibility and Urgency:** The project addresses a specific and relatable issue (lack of bike parking), which could resonate well with daily cyclists and residents in the area, potentially increasing its visibility and perceived urgency.
7. **Statistical Positioning:** Given the voting patterns and the project's attributes, it is likely to rank well but may not surpass major infrastructure projects due to its smaller scale and impact.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Dog Park, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm that prioritizes projects in descending order of votes until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its cost relative to its perceived benefits, and its alignment with prevalent community needs and values.

**Analysis of the Dog Park Project:**
1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The Dog Park project, costing ‚Ç¨15,000, is relatively inexpensive compared to other projects, which could make it more likely to be funded after higher-voted but more expensive projects are considered.
2. **District Voting Trends**: The district of Sept Deniers / Ginestous-Sesqui√®res / Lalande has shown moderate interest in community and recreational projects, with the highest votes around 61 for similar budget projects.
3. **Project Theme**: Dog parks generally have a specific but enthusiastic audience. Given the urban setting, such amenities might be in demand, potentially increasing voter interest.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar low-cost projects in the same district received votes ranging from 9 to 61. This project might perform better due to its broader appeal to dog owners.
5. **Historical Data**: Projects in this district with costs under ‚Ç¨20,000 had a maximum of 61 votes in the previous year.
6. **Voter Turnout and Distribution**: With an expected higher turnout and each voter having up to 3 votes, the project could attract a significant number of votes if it resonates well with the community.
7. **Ranking Estimation**: Given the project's moderate appeal and low cost, it is likely to rank well but might not break into the very top due to the district's historically moderate voting turnout.

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, the cost relative to the budget, and its relevance to community needs. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing widespread concerns tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project ""Cleanliness facilities near the pedestrian path at the Ar√®nes Romaines tram stop"":**
1. **Low Cost**: The project's cost is ‚Ç¨5,000, which is significantly lower than many other projects, potentially allowing it to be easily funded even if it doesn't receive a very high number of votes.
2. **District Voting History**: District 20 had a mixed response in the previous election, with projects receiving a wide range of votes. The most similar project in terms of theme and cost (""Place trash cans at all bus stops"") received only 17 votes.
3. **Project Relevance**: The project addresses a clear and specific local need, which could appeal to regular users of the area, potentially increasing its vote count.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar small-scale utility projects in the same district have historically not garnered a large number of votes.
5. **Increased Voter Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, the project might receive more votes than similar projects in the previous year, but this does not necessarily imply a top-ranking position.
6. **Project Visibility and Appeal**: The project's success will heavily depend on how effectively it is marketed to the electorate and its perceived impact compared to more ambitious projects.
7. **Overall District Engagement**: The average engagement level in District 20 suggests moderate interest, which might not be sufficient to push this project into the top ranks.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Slowing down and securing Salini√© road
- Cost: 10000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 18 - Lardenne / Pradettes / Basso-Cambo
- Description: The Salinie road is a heavily trafficked axis and will continue to be so with the new constructions in the neighborhood. This results in significant car traffic and the 30 km/h speed limit now visible on the road is not being respected. The sidewalks are very narrow in some places, so either adding speed bumps or creating ""chicanes"" would be necessary. I hope this would slow down traffic and reduce the danger for us and our children, as well as pollution! üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A project is already under study. Vehicle counts have been done and the need has already been identified. Given the existing speed moderating elements, there is a proposal to install an educational radar.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Slowing down and securing Salini√© road, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the total budget. Projects in districts with higher voter engagement or those addressing widespread concerns tend to receive more votes.

**Analysis of the project ""Slowing down and securing Salini√© road"":**
1. **Cost Efficiency**: The project's low cost (‚Ç¨10,000) compared to the total budget and other projects makes it more likely to be funded after higher-ranked, more expensive projects have been considered.
2. **District Voting History**: District 18 has shown moderate voter engagement and support for similar projects, such as the improvement of cycle paths and greening projects.
3. **Project Relevance**: The project addresses traffic and safety concerns, which are common and relatable issues for urban residents, potentially increasing its appeal.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar traffic and safety projects in other districts received a moderate number of votes, suggesting a baseline level of support for this type of initiative.
5. **Project Urgency and Support**: The description indicates existing studies and plans, suggesting that the project is well-founded and potentially supported by preliminary municipal assessments, which could influence voter perception positively.
6. **Historical Data from Similar Projects**: Projects with similar themes in the district, like speed bumps on Chemin du Touch, received very low votes, indicating potential challenges in achieving high voter turnout.
7. **Overall Voter Turnout and Engagement**: With an expected higher turnout, the project might benefit from increased overall engagement, but it also faces more competition from a larger number of projects (183 proposed projects).

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Renovate the old wall of the public garden in the Pays d'Oc
- Cost: 80000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 5 - Saint-Michel / Saint-Agne / Empalot / Le Busca / Ile du Ramier / Monplaisir
- Description: The ancient wall made of bricks and pebbles in the public garden of the Pays d'Oc, on Fran√ßois Longaud Street, is severely deteriorated, to the extent that in one place, it is so hole-ridden that one can see through to the other side. It is necessary to renovate this heritage in a traditional manner (using lime mortar) to halt its degradation and enhance its value. It is, moreover, the last remnant along with the century-old plane trees of the public garden of the former Notre-Dame de Charit√© du Refuge monastery, which was demolished at the end of the 1970s. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The garden wall will be renovated using traditional materials. To preserve the current identity of the wall, the renovation will involve replacing the missing pebbles and repairing the lime mortar. The wall's refurbishment will be subject to the opinion of the Architecte des B√¢timents de France.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Toulouse's Participatory Budgeting**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, who can vote for up to three projects. The total budget is allocated using a greedy algorithm, funding projects in descending order of votes until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the available budget.

**Analysis of the Project: Renovate the old wall of the public garden in the Pays d'Oc**

1. **District Voting History**: District 5 has shown strong support for community and environmental projects, with projects like tree planting and square development receiving substantial votes in the past.
2. **Project Cost**: At ‚Ç¨80,000, the project is moderately priced, which could allow it to be funded after higher-voted but more expensive projects are considered.
3. **Project Theme and Relevance**: The project focuses on heritage and environmental preservation, themes that have historically resonated well with voters in Toulouse, particularly in District 5.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in terms of theme and district have garnered a moderate number of votes, suggesting a baseline level of community interest.
5. **Increased Voter Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, there might be a slight increase in votes for all projects, but particularly those in popular categories like environmental conservation.
6. **Project Visibility and Appeal**: The project's focus on traditional renovation techniques and preserving historical heritage might appeal to a specific voter base interested in cultural preservation.
7. **Budget Constraints**: Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it is likely affordable within the budget constraints if it ranks reasonably high in votes.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Report and add a yield sign at the pedestrian/cyclist crossing at Laporte path.
- Cost: 1000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 20 - Ar√®nes Romaines / Ancely / Saint-Martin du Touch / Purpan
- Description: Currently, the crossing is over a speed bump that encourages slowing down, but there are no signs indicating that cyclists or pedestrians may be crossing. In summer, it can pass with the clarity of the days; however, in winter, it's just accident-prone. The example to follow is just a few meters away at 11 chemin de la Crabe where the crossing is prioritized for cyclists/pedestrians over motor vehicles: a yield sign and panels inform drivers. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Identified project currently under study along the entire route of REV 10 ‚Äì prioritization of cycle crossings at intersections. In connection with the association ""2 pieds 2 roues"".

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Report and add a yield sign at the pedestrian/cyclist crossing at Laporte path., listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Toulouse's Participatory Budgeting**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive from residents, who can vote for up to three projects. The projects are then funded in descending order of votes until the budget limit is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project, and the voting dynamics within specific districts.

**Analysis of the Project: ""Report and add a yield sign at the pedestrian/cyclist crossing at Laporte path.""**

1. **Low Cost**: The project's cost is very low (‚Ç¨1,000), which means it could be easily funded even late in the budget allocation process, as it represents a minimal financial risk.
   
2. **District Voting History**: District 20 had a mixed response in the previous year, with the highest voted project receiving 164 votes. Projects in this district did not generally receive a high number of votes compared to more central districts.

3. **Project Theme**: The project focuses on safety and clarity for cyclists and pedestrians, which is a recurring theme in successful projects across the city, indicating a potentially favorable voter response.

4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar safety and cycling-related projects across the city have received moderate to high votes, suggesting a general interest in such initiatives.

5. **Visibility and Urgency**: The project addresses a specific and clear issue (safety during winter), which might resonate well with local residents, especially those directly affected by the crossing.

6. **Number of Projects in District**: With 9 projects proposed in the district this year, competition is relatively high, which might dilute the votes among more projects.

7. **Historical Data and Trends**: Projects in District 20 have not historically been top vote-getters, which might suggest a ceiling on potential votes unless there is a significant change in voter turnout or preferences.

8. **Overall Appeal**: Given its practical nature and low cost, the project might appeal to a broad audience, but it may not ignite as much passion or visibility as larger, more transformative projects.

368;27;173;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the voting history and socio-economic characteristics of the district where the project is proposed.

**Analysis of the Project: Establishment of a fitness trail in the park near Bourliaguet School**

1. **District Voting History**: District 17 has historically shown low voter engagement and support for projects, with the highest voted project receiving only 33 votes in the previous year.
2. **Project Cost**: At ‚Ç¨30,000, the project is relatively affordable, which could make it more likely to be funded once it crosses a minimal vote threshold.
3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar fitness and sports-related projects in other districts have received modest vote counts, suggesting a moderate level of interest in such initiatives.
4. **Socio-economic Context**: District 17 may have different priorities or lower engagement in participatory budgeting, which could affect the voting turnout for this project.
5. **Project Appeal**: The project's focus on health and fitness could appeal to a specific demographic interested in outdoor activities, potentially increasing its votes within the community.
6. **Number of Projects in the District**: With 8 projects submitted in this district for the current year, competition among projects could dilute the number of votes for each project.
7. **Budget Constraints**: Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it is feasible to fund this project if it receives enough votes to rank it sufficiently high.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to local needs, and its cost relative to the available budget. District-specific voting patterns and historical voting data also play crucial roles in predicting project success.

**Analysis of the Project ""Creation of an early childhood game near Simone Veil school"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 17 has historically shown low voter engagement and support for projects, with average votes per project being significantly lower than in more active districts.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨65,000, the project is moderately priced, which might not drain the budget quickly and could be considered for funding after higher-voted, yet more expensive projects are evaluated.
3. **Relevance and Need:** The project addresses a specific need for early childhood play areas, which could appeal to families in the district. However, similar projects in the past have not garnered significant votes.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in other districts and within District 17 itself have generally received low votes, suggesting a possibly limited appeal or lower priority among voters.
5. **Historical Data on Similar Projects:** Projects focusing on children's play areas or similar amenities have not performed well in the past elections, often ranking low.
6. **Visibility and Campaigning:** The success might also hinge on how well the project is campaigned and made visible to the electorate, which is not quantifiable from the data provided but crucial for voter turnout and support.
7. **Increased Turnout Expectation:** While an increased turnout is expected, it's unclear if this will translate into higher votes for this project, given the historical voting trends in the district.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Arrow to turn right at the light 133 avenue des Ar√®nes Romaines (towards chemin de la Flamb√®re)
- Cost: 30000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 20 - Ar√®nes Romaines / Ancely / Saint-Martin du Touch / Purpan
- Description: At 133 Avenue des Ar√®nes Romaines, when we have Blagnac behind us and wish to head towards Chemin de la Flamb√®re, there is a traffic light at the tram stop. At this location, it forces a stop when red, even though it would be possible to continue if one wishes to turn right onto Chemin de la Flamb√®re (no crossing traffic). Therefore, it would be good to add a blinking arrow to allow this and thus ease the traffic flow. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The project must be studied by the Mobility Directorate concerning traffic lights and will have to be submitted to the STRMTG: State Services in charge of the tramway.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the distribution of votes among competing projects within the same district or across the city.

**Analysis of the Project ""Arrow to turn right at the light 133 avenue des Ar√®nes Romaines (towards chemin de la Flamb√®re)""**

1. **District Voting Patterns**: The project is in District 20, which had a moderate voting engagement in the previous year, with the most voted project receiving 164 votes. This suggests a moderate level of voter participation and interest in local improvements.
   
2. **Project Cost and Appeal**: The project cost (‚Ç¨30,000) is relatively low compared to other infrastructure projects, which could make it more likely to be funded within the budget constraints. Its practical nature aimed at improving traffic flow may appeal to daily commuters and local residents.

3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar infrastructure projects in other districts received a range of votes, often correlating with the project's visibility and direct impact on residents' daily lives. Given the moderate cost and specific utility, this project might attract a similar or slightly higher interest compared to the district's average.

4. **Expected Voter Turnout and Project Competition**: With an increased voter turnout expected and 183 projects proposed city-wide, competition might be stiffer. However, the project's practical benefit could help it stand out.

5. **Historical Data and Project Ranking**: Analyzing similar projects from the previous year, infrastructure projects that directly addressed daily inconveniences tended to perform moderately well, suggesting this project could attract a significant number of votes but might not break into the very top due to its less universal appeal compared to broader projects like green spaces or major road redevelopments.

6. **Strategic Importance and Safety**: The project involves a traffic management improvement, which is typically less visually appealing but crucial for safety and convenience, possibly garnering support from those directly affected.

7. **Budget Allocation Strategy**: Given the project's lower cost, it stands a good chance of being funded after more expensive projects have been considered, assuming it garners enough votes to be considered a priority.

244;24;176;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its cost relative to the budget, and its district's voting history. Projects with higher votes get priority in funding, but expensive projects may be skipped if they exceed the remaining budget.

**Analysis of the Project ""Development of Rue de la Cressoni√®re by adding greenery"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 19 has shown moderate interest in similar projects, with the highest voted similar project receiving 130 votes.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨150,000, the cost is substantial but comparable to other funded projects in the district, suggesting it's within a feasible funding range.
3. **Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects across the city have received a wide range of votes, indicating variability based on specific project appeal and district interest.
4. **Project Description and Appeal:** The project aims to enhance urban greenery and pedestrian access, which are popular themes. However, the description notes potential issues like soil quality and parking removal, which might reduce its appeal.
5. **Voter Turnout and Project Competition:** With a higher expected turnout and 183 projects competing, the project faces stiff competition. The project's success will partly depend on how it stands out among many options.
6. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in the same district have not ranked very high, suggesting a potential challenge in breaking into the top ranks.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it's likely affordable within the budget if it garners enough votes, but it's not guaranteed if many higher-voted projects also demand funding.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Securing Jean Gilles' Maury Park
- Cost: 150000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 17 - Mirail-Universit√© / Reynerie / Bellefontaine
- Description: The Park is dangerous for everyone, especially children. Scooters and bikes speed through it. It is necessary to enclose the Park to secure it and prevent an imminent accident. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: This area is not open to motorized two-wheelers, which are not allowed to circulate here. Unfortunately, these violations are frequent. However, simply installing a fence will not prevent acts of incivility and should not confine the users of this park. It is recommended to install a barrier enclosure with a height of 1m, supplemented by swinging gates that hinder the access of two-wheelers.

Based on:
- Voting dynamics observed in the 2022 election
- The cost, district, and theme of the project
- Your understanding of the social, ecological, and political context in Toulouse

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Securing Jean Gilles' Maury Park, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to its perceived benefits. District-specific voting patterns and historical engagement also play crucial roles.

**Analysis of the Project ""Securing Jean Gilles' Maury Park"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 17 has historically shown low voter engagement and support for projects, with the highest voted project in 2022 receiving only 33 votes.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨150,000, the project is moderately expensive, which could be a significant factor given the limited budget and the district's low voting turnout.
3. **Project Theme:** Safety and security are compelling themes, but the district's historical data suggests limited enthusiasm for large-scale investments.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar safety and infrastructure projects in other districts have received a mixed response, suggesting that success can vary significantly based on local demographics and needs.
5. **Voter Turnout and Engagement:** An expected higher turnout could increase the total votes for the project; however, the district's past performance may not proportionally benefit from this increase.
6. **Project Visibility and Appeal:** The project's focus on safety might resonate well given frequent violations mentioned in the description, potentially increasing its appeal.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the total budget and the cost of the project, it's feasible but might be deprioritized if there are many higher-voted, lower-cost projects.

330;23;178;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated using a greedy algorithm that prioritizes projects in descending order of votes until the budget cap is reached. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and perceived utility, the cost of the project relative to its benefits, and the distribution of votes across projects. Projects in districts with higher engagement and voter turnout tend to perform better, as do projects that address widely felt needs or innovative solutions.

**Application of Framework to the Project ""Implementation of 'shape detection' lighting on rue Lefranc de Pompignan""**

1. **District Voting History**: District 13 had a moderate average vote count in the previous election, suggesting a decent level of engagement but not the highest in the city.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: The project's cost (‚Ç¨10,000) is relatively low, which could allow it to be easily funded within the available budget, making it a financially attractive option.
3. **Project Theme and Appeal**: The project focuses on innovative, eco-friendly lighting, which aligns with contemporary urban concerns about energy efficiency and safety, potentially increasing its appeal.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: A similar project in the same district (""Motion sensor street lamps South canal bike path"") received 50 votes and ranked 76th, indicating moderate interest in similar themes.
5. **Expected Increase in Voter Turnout**: With an expected higher turnout, there might be a proportional increase in votes for all projects, but innovative and utility-focused projects might benefit more.
6. **Project Visibility and Understanding**: The project's success will depend on how well it is communicated and understood by the voters, as its technical nature (shape detection) might not be immediately clear to all.
7. **Competition with Other Projects**: With 183 projects proposed, the competition might dilute the votes, but the lower cost and practical appeal of this project could help it stand out.

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS**
Start with a ‚ÄúStep Back‚Äù:
1. In 2 to 3 sentences, summarize the general rules that explain project outcomes in participatory budgeting in Toulouse (main factors, voting dynamics, etc.).
2. Then, apply this general framework to the analysis of the project Installation of a bike repair stand at La Reynerie, listing 5 to 8 key points that justify your estimates.
3. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.
";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility, its relevance to community needs, and its cost relative to the available budget. District-specific voting patterns and historical engagement also play crucial roles.

**Analysis of the Project ""Installation of a bike repair stand at La Reynerie"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 17 has historically shown low voter engagement and support for projects, with the highest voted project receiving only 33 votes in 2022.
2. **Project Cost:** The low cost (‚Ç¨5,000) of the bike repair stand project is favorable as it allows for easy funding within the budget constraints.
3. **Relevance and Practicality:** The project addresses a practical need for cyclists, which could appeal to a specific community subset, potentially increasing its votes.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar low-cost projects in other districts have received moderate support, suggesting a potential for a decent number of votes but not exceptionally high.
5. **Voter Turnout and Distribution:** With an expected higher turnout and 183 projects, the vote distribution might be more spread out, affecting the total votes this project might receive.
6. **Project Visibility and Appeal:** Given the low historical engagement in District 17 and the niche appeal of the project (targeting cyclists specifically), the project might not attract widespread attention.
7. **Historical Data from Similar Projects:** Projects with a similar theme or cost in other districts have not ranked in the top 50, indicating a possible lower ranking for this project as well.

Your task now is to evaluate a new project submitted to the upcoming election, which features **183 proposed projects**, and a higher turnout is expected.

**Project to analyze:**
- Name: Remove the asphalt from the parking spaces on Bernadette Street
- Cost: 240000.0 ‚Ç¨
- District: 15 - Croix de Pierre / Route d'Espagne
- Description: I propose removing the asphalt from the parking spaces on Bernadette Street. Indeed, why keep tar in an area where no one drives? Instead, we could do like the T√©l√©o parking. Cars would still be able to park as before, but the advantage is that water could seep through and replenish the groundwater, which is very useful in the summer. üîé WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Implementation of a clear draining concrete in the parking spaces on Bernadette Street. Opportunity for greening the central island and some parking spaces.

";"**Step Back:**
In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. Key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, and its cost relative to the total budget and other competing projects. Projects in districts with higher average votes or those addressing widely felt needs tend to perform better.

**Analysis of ""Remove the asphalt from the parking spaces on Bernadette Street"":**
1. **District Voting History:** The district of Croix de Pierre / Route d'Espagne has a moderate voting engagement, with projects receiving an average of 45.1 votes in 2022. The highest voted project in this district received 125 votes.
2. **Project Cost:** At ‚Ç¨240,000, this project is relatively expensive, which could limit its feasibility under the budget constraints unless it garners significant voter support.
3. **Project Theme:** The ecological and urban improvement theme aligns with successful projects from previous years, suggesting potential voter support.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar greening projects in other districts have received a moderate number of votes, but none have been top performers, suggesting a ceiling on potential votes.
5. **Previous Similar Project in the Same District:** A similar greening project in this district (""Greening Croix de Pierre"") received 79 votes and ranked 47th, indicating a precedent but not a strong one.
6. **Project Visibility and Appeal:** The project's success will depend heavily on its promotion and the perceived impact on local residents' quality of life.
7. **Budget Constraints:** Given the high cost, the project must compete with others for a limited pool of funds, which could be a significant barrier unless it proves exceptionally popular.

";"**Step Back: Summary of General Rules for Project Outcomes in Participatory Budgeting in Toulouse**

In Toulouse's participatory budgeting, projects are selected based on the number of votes they receive, with funding allocated to the most popular projects until the budget is exhausted. The key factors influencing project outcomes include the project's appeal to voters, its visibility and relevance to the community, the cost of the project relative to its perceived benefits, and the voting dynamics within different districts. Projects in districts with historically higher engagement and average votes tend to perform better.

**Analysis of the Project: Set up tables and chairs at Jean Gilles' Maury Park**

1. **District Voting History**: District 17 has shown low voter engagement and support in previous participatory budgeting, with projects receiving relatively few votes compared to other districts.
   
2. **Project Cost**: At ‚Ç¨85,000, the project is moderately priced, which might not deter its selection but is significant enough to require substantial voter support to justify the expenditure.

3. **Comparison with Similar Projects**: Similar projects in other districts have had mixed results, with some receiving moderate support. However, projects in District 17 specifically have not garnered significant votes.

4. **Project Utility and Appeal**: The project addresses a basic need (seating and tables in a park), which has universal appeal, potentially increasing its chances of receiving votes.

5. **Increased Turnout Expectation**: With an expected higher turnout, there might be a slight increase in votes for all projects, but this does not necessarily translate to a proportionate increase for projects in less engaged districts.

6. **Historical Data from Similar Projects**: Projects enhancing park facilities have not ranked very high in previous elections, especially in less active districts.

7. **Budget Constraints**: Given the total budget and the cost of higher-ranking projects, this project might be considered if many high-cost projects are not prioritized.

8. **Competition within District**: With 8 projects submitted in District 17, competition for votes within the district could dilute the total votes received by each project.

374;17;183;"You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website. Votes are anonymous.

Here is how projects are selected:
- All projects are ranked according to the number of votes received.
- A greedy algorithm is applied: projects are funded in decreasing order of votes, as long as the total budget is not exceeded.
- If a project is too expensive for the remaining budget, it is skipped and the algorithm proceeds to the next one.

**Analysis of ""Improving the cleanliness of the Jean Gilles playground"":**
1. **District Voting History:** District 17 has shown low voter engagement and support for projects in past elections, with projects receiving relatively few votes.
2. **Project Cost:** The low cost (‚Ç¨3,000) of the project is a favorable factor as it allows for easy funding within the budget constraints.
3. **Project Theme:** The project focuses on children's play areas, which can be a popular theme, but similar projects have not performed strongly in this district.
4. **Comparison with Similar Projects:** Similar projects in other districts also received low votes, suggesting a possibly lower interest in such projects city-wide.
5. **Historical Data:** The highest voted project in this district in the previous year received only 33 votes, indicating a ceiling that might be hard to exceed.
6. **Project Necessity and Description:** The project description suggests improvements that might not be seen as urgent or essential, as existing facilities are in good condition.
7. **Overall Appeal:** Given the district's low engagement and the project's non-critical enhancements, the project is unlikely to attract a high number of votes.
