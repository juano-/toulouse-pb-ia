In Wroclaw, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives on the official website.

Once the voting period ends, the projects are ranked according to the number of votes received. Then, the winning projects are selected using a greedy algorithm: starting with the project that received the most votes, projects are added one by one in decreasing order of votes, as long as the available budget allows. If the next project in the list exceeds the remaining budget, it is skipped in favor of the next affordable one, and so on, until the total budget of 4500000 € is exhausted.
Your task is to analyze the following project, proposed as part of a new participatory budgeting election:

Project: Rędziński Park
Cost: 1000000 €
District: Krzyki
Description: Justification
The concept of the Park in Maślice was designed based on a survey conducted among its current users. It takes into account two main target groups: families with children and young, active sports enthusiasts. Currently, this area is perceived by residents as a green space—unfortunately, neglected. Given the development of the estate and the need to create new meeting places for residents, as well as Wrocław's efforts to earn the title of European Green Capital, this area should gain a new look.

The park development project includes paths, prepared based on the state of tree cover and potential costs of clearing the trails to a minimum width of 2.5 m—cycling, running, and walking paths—leveled and prepared for stroller access. Additionally, the project includes health trail routes connected by crossings made of wooden bridges, culverts, and balance beams. The paths will be connected to sandy squares where wooden play equipment and willow wigwams will be located. The park's hill will also be utilized—it will be planted with a spiral hedge, and plastic slides will be built into its sides. At the top, there will be a viewing point with a circular gazebo and swing benches.

The park paths will be equipped with a series of educational and sensory boards. Existing blackberry hedges will be densified with raspberry bushes in various varieties and fruiting seasons. The concept also includes the development of two water reservoirs. Two crossings over them in the form of wooden bridges are planned. Near one of the ponds, there will be a spot for exercises with a shock-absorbing surface and a place for outdoor gym equipment. The area will also feature two fire pits, gazebos, benches, and wooden loungers made from tree trunks.

Project: bus stop infrastructure on Dawida Street
Cost: 250000 €
District: Śródmieście
Description: Justification
On Dawida Street (between Dawida Street and Dyrekcyjna Street) there is a bus loop for private carriers, which is heavily used by many residents of Wrocław and people living in the surrounding areas within several dozen kilometers. Unfortunately, Dawida Street lacks decent infrastructure - sidewalks (the existing concrete ones are in poor condition and are uncomfortable to use, especially in winter), bus shelters (even just to protect against rain), benches, street lamps, trash bins, or clear timetables (there are several stops and if someone is not familiar with them, i.e., does not know from which stop a particular carrier departs, it can be a bit confusing). Changes would enable more pleasant and easier use of this bus loop.
I qualify this project as city-wide, as residents from various parts of the city and from nearby towns use this infrastructure.
P.S. I heard that the city plans to change the location of the stops for private carriers - if this is the case, please inform me and possibly then the project will be withdrawn.

Project: ""Park & ride"" at the Pilczyce/Wrocław Stadium loop
Cost: 750000 €
District: Fabryczna
Description: Justification
""Park & ride"" are parking facilities for those coming to large cities wishing to use public transport. It is an eco-friendly solution used in modern large cities. The project plans to create 80 parking spaces. Due to the proximity of the A8 motorway entrance to the city and the Pilczyce loop (100m), the parking is ideally located for use by people coming from outside Wrocław, who will leave their car in the parking lot and switch to public transport (tram lines: 33, 3, 10, 20; bus line: 128). Additionally, the spaces can be used by people driving to mass events organized at the Municipal Stadium (300m). The implementation of the project will increase the safety of residents and cars parked during events at the stadium. It will also improve the image of the city of Wrocław (especially during stadium events). It will prevent the devastation of green areas. Currently, during mass events at the stadium, due to cars parked on the road, dangerous situations and collisions occur. Due to the lack of space, cars are unable to pass or turn around. Often, they have to back out of the alley up to 200 m. There is devastation of green areas due to the blocked road (passing through lawns and sidewalks) or parking on the lawns.

Its proximity to major transport links and the stadium increases its relevance and potential appeal to a broad audience.

2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: With a cost of 750,000 €, the project is moderately expensive but not prohibitively so, allowing for the possibility of funding within the available budget of 4,500,000 €. This cost positions it well among other potential projects that might either be far cheaper or significantly more expensive.

3. **District Influence**: Located in the Fabryczna district, which is a significant and populous part of Wroclaw, the project is likely to attract attention from local residents who directly benefit from reduced traffic and improved parking facilities.

4. **Environmental and Safety Benefits**: The project promotes environmental benefits by reducing the need for cars in the city center and enhancing safety during stadium events, aligning with contemporary urban planning trends towards sustainability and safety.

5. **Voting Dynamics and Historical Data**: Based on typical participatory budgeting dynamics, projects that address widespread issues like traffic and public safety tend to perform well. Assuming a moderate level of competition and no extremely high-impact projects overshadowing it, this project should attract a substantial number of votes.

6. **Estimation Methodology**: Considering the factors above, a reasonable estimate of votes might be derived from similar past projects in Wroclaw or comparable cities. The project's broad appeal, moderate cost, and significant impact suggest it would be in the upper-middle range of vote-getters.

7. **Ranking Prediction**: Given the cost-to-benefit ratio and the project's appeal, it is likely to rank well unless there are numerous other projects with either a significantly lower cost or higher immediate impact. The project's moderate cost allows it to be feasibly funded within the total budget, assuming normal distribution of project costs.

Project: Operation Square - Street Games ""Taming the Concrete""
Cost: 150000 €
District: Śródmieście
Description: Justification
The project involves placing street games in urban spaces designed for children of various age groups.
The project has two main objectives:
- encourage children to play in urban spaces
- make use of hardened surfaces such as concrete, asphalt, or paving stones.
Street games made of thermoplastic material are a supplement to traditional playgrounds or an idea for utilizing alleys, courtyards, and wastelands, and can serve as a modern educational aid especially for preschool, early school, and physical education teachers, as well as an idea for actively spending free time for entire families.
By transforming gray courtyards and squares into colorful zones for play and learning, we show children
that one can have great fun away from the screen of a monitor and television.
Thermoplastic material is characterized by high resistance to weather conditions, includes anti-slip elements, and the colors do not lose their intensity.
The installation of Smart Plac games involves the thermoplastic material vulcanizing with the hardened surface during heating (with asphalt, paving stones, or concrete), which ensures high durability and longevity of the product.

Project: I'm sorry, but you didn't provide any text to translate. Please provide the text you would like translated from Polish to English.
Cost: 50000 €
District: Krzyki
Description: Justification
The idea behind the ""1997"" project was to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the residents' struggle with the flood, which has been remembered as the Flood of the Millennium.
Twenty locations were selected where a delicate, elongated, copper plaque with the cut-out numbers 1997 will be mounted. The defined places - facades of buildings that had to face the powerful element on July 12-13, 1997, are characteristic points in the city center and housing estates.
The project's aim is to make visitors aware and remind locals of the hardships that the residents of Wrocław had to overcome for life in the city to return to normal. A city-wide nature of the proposal was chosen to illustrate the actual scale of the flood.
The proposal is characterized by modesty; the rectangular plaques are meant to address the flood in a non-didactic way, to intrigue. The proposed size is 40 cm in length and 3 cm in width. The thickness is 1 cm, so as to conceal the mounting. The height of the mounting depends on the water level from July 1997.

Your task is to analyze the following project, proposed as part of a new participatory budgeting election:

Project: Safe and friendly roads in Wrocław - speed calming lights instead of speed cameras throughout the city
Cost: 650000 €
District: Psie Pole
Description: Justification
The project proposes changing the operating mode of traffic lights at selected intersections to improve pedestrian comfort and overall safety. The main change will be switching the signals to an ""all-green"" mode for pedestrians – meaning that when there are no cars on the road, the green light will continuously be on at crosswalks, allowing pedestrians to cross freely without having to press buttons and wait. The change occurs only when a column of cars approaches. The second feature would be slowing lights - when a car approaches an intersection or a pedestrian crossing with traffic lights, its speed is monitored by cameras, and if it is driving too fast, the light turns red. The green light comes back on once it reduces speed - if it does not, the camera records the moment of running the red light, and only then is a fine issued. This system is much more driver-friendly than the traditional speed camera - if someone's foot lingers on the gas pedal, they do not immediately receive a fine, but a warning in the form of a red light, and only if they ignore it are they penalized. It is also a more effective solution - it reduces speed in the most dangerous places, namely at intersections and pedestrian crossings. Slowing lights are operational in Wrocław at the intersection of Ślężna and Weigla, so this is not a novelty in our city.
Proposals:
1. Krakowska – pedestrian crossing (signal no. 231)
2. Bardzka – pedestrian crossing (signal no. 243)
3. Popowicka – pedestrian crossing
4. Klecińska – allotment gardens (signal no. 200)
5. Grabiszyńska – Bzowa (signal no. 219)

Project: Network of parks in Wrocław – Psie Pole - Zawidawie 2
Cost: 1000000 €
District: Stare Miasto
Description: Justification
The aim of the project is to create two green areas in the Psie Pole -Zawidawie district - a green square at Psie Pole (behind FAMA) and part of the park at Zakrzów. Connecting areas located on two different sides of Sobieski Avenue aims to activate residents of the entire district around a common project within the framework of WBO 2017. The first part of the project is to be located on plots situated behind the FAMA Library and Cultural Center. The space designated for development is bordered on one side by the access road to the tenements, leading from the parking lot, the parking lot itself (bordering all the mentioned plots), a garbage disposal area, and the FAMA territory (surface laid with granite slabs). The initiative envisages the creation of a green square with a mini playground. In the central location, there would be a colorful Linarium Mount Logan structure in the Triangulum version – 3153303 (or a similar rope structure), placed on a sandy substrate. There would be 4 accesses to the playground – gravel paths (in an X layout) and a path surrounding the square along with benches and garbage bins. The remaining parts would be occupied by flower beds (perennials blooming from spring to autumn) and trees – small-leaved lindens. The second part of the project involves the development of a plot located at Zakrzów, in an area bounded by Kujbyszewska, Królewska, and Zatorska streets. In this space, the plan includes the creation of an irregular gravel path/paths, an integration square for the residents of Os. Sobieski, and a dog run (this is consistent with the concept concerning Unity Park, WBO 2014 project). Additionally, new lawns will be established and trees planted in the designed space. This part of the park will also feature bicycle racks, trash bins, and benches.

Project: Green stops in the city center
Cost: 320000 €
District: Fabryczna
Description: Justification
The project proposes the creation of green stops at selected locations in downtown Wrocław by planting climbing plants on their structures. The vegetation would grow in boxes and would be introduced onto lattices along the sides and back wall of the shelters, without interfering with their structure. Thanks to the planting of climbers, waiting for public transport vehicles will become more pleasant, and the bus shelters will gain a new, more aesthetic form.
The project is part of efforts to earn Wrocław the title of Green Capital of Europe, adds a new aesthetic value to the urban space, and introduces greenery in places that have been devoid of it until now. Similar structures have been successfully functioning for years in many cities including London, Eindhoven, Novi Sad, and this year, Kraków plans to introduce green stops.
Proposed locations for green stops:
- Main Station (3 stops)
- Arkady Capitol (2 stops)
- Bema Square (2 stops)
- Galeria Dominikańska (2 stops)
- Strzegomski Square (Contemporary Museum) (2 stops)

Project: Reagan Roundabout up to standard! Construction of platforms at Reagan Roundabout.
Cost: 1000000 €
District: Psie Pole
Description: Justification
Reagan Roundabout is one of the more important transit hubs. Unfortunately, the low edges of the stops make it difficult for the elderly, disabled, or parents with strollers to board. As a result, the boarding and alighting of passengers take longer - we ALL lose out! Enough of the uncomfortable climb into buses or trams!
This is a continuation of the WBO 2016 project no. 82. In the previous edition, project 82 and 686 (convergent) together gathered over 1200 votes, indicating significant interest from residents in the matter of convenient boarding at this important transit point.
The proposed changes include raising the platforms by at least 25 cm on the eastern side (2 platforms from Norwida Street) to minimize the gap during boarding.

Project: Green Beltway of Wrocław - trees and vines in Wrocław's neighborhoods
Cost: 100000 €
District: Krzyki
Description: Justification
The project assumes the planting of trees in all housing estates along the Wrocław Motorway Bypass from Muchobor Wielki through Żerniki, Kuźniki, Pilczyce, Rędzin, Osobowice, Lipa Piotrowska, Widawa, Polanowice, and Pawłowice. The course of the AOW through residential areas and lands that could serve recreational functions (e.g., Pola Osobowickie) results in inconveniences for residents in the form of excessive noise throughout the day, a high amount of air pollution, and moreover, the concrete structure of acoustic screens has questionable aesthetic values. Many sections also lack acoustic insulation. Planting trees would to some extent reduce the unfavorable proximity of the AOW. Concrete acoustic screens could be covered with vines on the outer side.
Along the AOW, there are many places where trees can be planted and existing plantings supplemented (e.g., the area at Sułowska Street: Widawa plot, AR_16, 10/1, where only very small pines grow - adding tall deciduous trees would have a very positive impact on this place), strips along so-called technical roads and others. Near the AOW, there are municipal plots, e.g., in the Osobowice-Rędzin estate, and state-owned property in many places should not be an obstacle.

Project: Sequoia forest, fruit trees and shrubs
Cost: 150000 €
District: Stare Miasto
Description: Justification
1. Few people know that once, powerful and ancient sequoias not only covered the area of the western coast of the USA but were also present throughout Europe. These are some of the oldest trees, as they can live for several thousand years and are certainly the largest of all. Few also know that in Poland, individual specimens grow, as well as in other European countries. The project assumes the initiation of restoring sequoia species in Poland, in Wrocław. The plan is to plant at least 50 of them in Wrocław's parks and forests. For them to function and produce new seedlings, the sequoias should be genetically diverse, originating from different regions/sources. To increase their chances of survival, they should be planted in at least 10 locations, with 5 genetically varied specimens each, along with a possible partial soil exchange for one that has the appropriate pH for them. Consultation with arborists will be useful here.
2. Utilitarian trees on wastelands will be publicly accessible. It takes some time for them to grow and bear fruit, but the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the next best time is now. Volunteers could be involved in the planting action to reduce the cost of this. Therefore, it might be possible to plant more of them eventually. It would be very important to plant a variety of species and seedlings. Plantings on wastelands would not increase the costs of greenery management, as such areas are not cared for as much as parks. Species and varieties should be chosen with special consideration for old Polish valuable and disappearing types, and the choice should be consulted with horticulture specialists.
3. Planting other trees in the city, in residential estates, in the vicinity of streets, squares, and plazas.

Project: City toilets in parks befitting Wrocław.
Cost: 1000000 €
District: Śródmieście
Description: Justification
The initiative is a response to the problem of a lack of public toilets in the recreational spaces of the city. It involves the construction of 3 facilities in Wrocław parks, which are still not equipped with such amenities (Western Park, Grabiszyński Park, and Eastern Park). The toilet project was honored with the Grand Prix award at the KOŁO Bathroom 2015 competition.

The comprehensive program of the facility includes:
toilets: male, female, and for disabled persons
a room for mothers with children
a covered resting place (bench)
a drinking fountain and a place for animals to drink water
bicycle racks
a technical room
The cost of implementing one facility is about 330,000 PLN - an amount of 1 million PLN would allow for the construction of 3 such toilets.

The project will enrich the parks with a hygienic and functional space, giving park users greater freedom. The concept is universal and flexible, and its scope can be expanded to include additional parks.

“The winning project is a multifunctional concept, naturally integrated into the park space. The center of the composition is a tree that serves as a spatial and symbolic reference point for the project.”
“The principle adopted for the toilet complex is simple and modest, adapted to the necessary intimacy of using the space while ensuring the assigned cultural function and an impressive and elegant setting. Inexpensive and easy-to-maintain finishing materials will provide a good backdrop for the effectively proposed lighting, which will enrich the garden space in the evening and at night,” explains the jury's choice.

Project: Greenery for Wrocław – pocket parks, plantings, green enclaves throughout the city!
Cost: 1000000 €
District: Psie Pole
Description: Justification
In Wrocław, there has been a declarative change regarding greenery and environmental care in general. Unfortunately, changes do not occur too quickly on a daily basis. The city still lacks trees in many places, even though the existing underground networks do not interfere with plantings. During the construction of new buildings, there is no consideration for landscaping with anything other than low vegetation (shrubs or grasses), which results in empty spaces around them that heat up quickly, which is particularly troublesome in the summer.

Another problem is the neglected green spaces, and often those devoid of greenery. They could serve as meeting places for residents, make waiting for the tram more pleasant, or simply provide an opportunity to rest among vegetation. Unfortunately, worn-out lawns, lack of benches, or shade do not encourage such activities.

Another issue is the valuable green enclaves from a biodiversity perspective, which can be found especially in peripheral estates. It is worth preserving them, cleaning them up, and equipping them with infrastructure for animals, such as birdhouses or hedgehog houses.

Therefore, as part of the Greenery for Wrocław project, I propose creating pocket parks in various places around the city, additional tree plantings, and the protection of natural green enclaves.

The beneficiaries of the project will be all city residents living or working/studying near the selected locations. The implementation of the project will also positively affect the local climate and improve the aesthetics of public spaces.

Project: Physicists' Boulevard - a scientific playground in the urban space (city-wide)
Cost: 1000000 €
District: Psie Pole
Description: Justification
We propose the creation of an installation initially comprising several educational devices for children, youth, and adults related to physics on the J. Zwierzycki Boulevard adjacent to the building of the Faculty of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Wrocław. The devices are intended to be unique, hence they will not be numerous and will be custom-made or ordered from specialized companies. The project is designed to initiate a larger whole, which we aim to implement in the future (a science park).

In Wrocław, there is a lack of recreational areas with an educational function. Warsaw has its Copernicus Center, Wrocław has the Humanitarium - small and very distant from the center, only with a temporary exhibition installation in the building. In this context, our project will be unique in Wrocław and the surrounding area.

Additionally, the project assumes the creation of both the entire concept and the landscaping, which will allow for the installation of these devices on the (beautiful) boulevard in an aesthetic and coherent manner with the surroundings.

The details of the devices, their form, and physical content will be determined with the project leader in collaboration with the scientific staff of the Faculty of Physics and Astronomy during the project implementation stage.

Project: Wrocław parks available to everyone.
Cost: 200000 €
District: Fabryczna
Description: Justification
Parks are an integral part of the urban fabric. They enable pleasant and quick contact with nature. Due to their location and the infrastructure on their premises, many of them are also tourist attractions. To increase the accessibility of Wrocław's parks, the project proposes placing tactile maps at the entrances to selected parks. These plans will allow blind and visually impaired individuals to familiarize themselves with the topography of the areas depicted. They will learn the layout of paths and the location of interesting objects. Descriptions in black print will make the maps accessible to all visitors to Wrocław's parks and help them reach interesting places.
The tactile plans made of stainless steel with engraving will be resistant to weather conditions and potential vandalism attacks. Proposed locations:
1. Szczytnicki Park (entrance near Hala Stulecia tram stop), 2. Szczytnicki Park (entrance near Kochanowskiego tram stop), 3. Grabiszyński Park (entrance near Oporów tram stop), 4. Grabiszyński Park (entrance near Grabiszyńska Cmentarz II tram stop), 5. Western Park (entrance near DH Astra tram stop), 6. Western Park (entrance near Kolista tram stop), 7. Southern Park (near Orla tram stop), 8. Southern Park (entrance near Krzyki tram stop), 9. J. Słowacki Park (intersection of Słowackiego Avenue with Staromiejska Promenade), 10. Leśnicki Park (entrance near Świętojański Square).
Additionally, the project includes the creation of an educational trail in Szczytnicki Park, which will consist of 20 hardened thermoforms of leaves from trees most commonly found in Poland. Additionally, the embossed graphics will be supplemented with black print and Braille descriptions of each species.
The cost of purchasing one plan is approximately 13,000 PLN, and the cost of purchasing one thermoform is approximately 3,300 PLN.

Project: Construction of the Wrocław handbike type integrative bicycle rental facility along with appropriate social and sanitary facilities.
Cost: 600000 €
District: Krzyki
Description: Justification
The project is designed for both disabled and able-bodied residents of Wrocław, as well as for guests and tourists.
Handbike bicycles allow for free and independent movement around the city despite any physical limitations. Thanks to the rental service, disabled individuals will be able to more fully enjoy the benefits of urban life, regardless of communication barriers. Creating such a place will allow for the integration of able-bodied and disabled people.
The project consists of two elements: the first is a bicycle shelter with handbike bicycles housed within; the second element is a social-sanitary building in a container (single-story) construction with an area of about 50 sqm. The building, intended for office or exhibition use and accessible throughout the year, will provide a space where cyclists can rest, share experiences, use a restroom adapted for the disabled, eat a meal, repair or adjust their bicycles. The building will be fully architecturally adapted to the needs of disabled persons.
The building, serving among other things as a community center, club, or simply a meeting place, will be equipped with the aforementioned toilet module, a kitchen sink with cabinetry, appliances such as a kettle, toaster, sandwich maker, microwave oven, tables, chairs, cabinets, bicycle tools, a lift, and a heating-cooling system.
We have several years of experience in operating and developing the Integrated Bicycle Rental www.roweryintegracyjne.pl.
The organization of activities undertaken as a result of the project will be handled by employees and volunteers of the DOBRY CEL foundation, which has supported socially excluded individuals since its inception.

Project: Wrocław at your fingertips – tactile maps of selected areas of Wrocław.
Cost: 130000 €
District: Stare Miasto
Description: Justification
The market and all places such as Ostrów Tumski, Centennial Hall with the Pergola are an undisputed tourist attraction of the city. But does everyone have equal access to them? Blind and visually impaired people have difficulty moving independently in unfamiliar terrain. Also, a person with a mobility disability should have the opportunity to enjoy the attractions offered by the city.

An ideal solution are tactile maps located in several important places, such as Ostrów Tumski, Centennial Hall with the Pergola, Słodowa Island, Piasek Island, the Market Square, National Forum of Music with Podwale, the Palace in Leśnica, the Old Town Park with the Puppet Theater, and Dunikowski Boulevard. These are tactile maps with a simplified representation of space and marking of the most important zones and points. They contain descriptions in Braille and help in optimally designing a route.

The maps allow for spatial orientation of blind and visually impaired people, as well as sighted individuals. They are made of durable material. The maps clearly represent the topography of the terrain for people with visual impairments, while allowing for independent movement around the city. Able-bodied people can use them like traditional maps. Thus, the maps will be attractive to tourists and residents.

We all want to explore and experience new places and attractions. We also have an internal need for social responsibility for those less fortunate. Let's do something together by combining all these needs and allow others to touch Wrocław. Let our city be adapted for the disabled. Let's show how it's done!

The cost of purchasing one plan is about 13,000 PLN.

Description: Justification
The Jelcz MEX convertible bus - Fredruś is listed in the register of monuments of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship. It was donated to the city in 1974 during the Wrocław Days. Since then, it has become a symbol of the city, transporting tourists and residents.
The name ""Fredruś"" was given in honor of Aleksander Fredro. However, since 2009 the bus has been immobilized and its prolonged exposure to the open air has severely deteriorated its technical condition, and now substantial financial resources are necessary to restore it to operation. This includes a complete reconstruction of the body, regeneration of details, and the vehicle's driving system, including the engine.
The project's goal is to enable residents, tourists, and guests to explore our city in an interesting way, and it should be noted that this bus has graced all parades and festivals of Wrocław. Let's renovate Fredruś and return it to the residents.

Project: ""Konikowo"" - Construction of an original playground at the Wrocław Racecourse - Partynice
Cost: 1000000 €
District: Stare Miasto
Description: Justification
Dear Residents of Wrocław, Dear Neighbors,
I represent the informal group ""I am from Ołtaszyn and the surrounding area – TOGETHER MORE VIBRANTLY"" (over 2200 members), who act together, help each other, and recommend family-friendly places. Very important spots on the map of Wrocław are playgrounds, and as we notice, there are still far too few of them.
Therefore, I am asking for support for our playground project on the premises of the Wrocław Racecourse – Partynice.
Why at Partynice?
- It is a public space (green, quiet, and safe area).
- It is easily accessible by public transport or car.
- There are horses here, loved by children.
- There is suitable infrastructure, toilets, a bar with great homemade food.
- The outdoor events organized here attract thousands of residents of Wrocław. As the Racecourse Management announces, during horse races, children will be taken care of by professional animators who will ensure fun and supervision.
- The surrounding playgrounds are mostly located in closed, constantly developing estates or are unfriendly (polluted, difficult to access, without shade, in a noisy place, by the street, etc.).
The proposed project will ensure safety and psychomotor development of children thanks to original and authorial equipment related to horses and equestrianism.
The Krzyki-Partynice neighborhood council has embraced our idea with enthusiasm.
Both the Racecourse Management and the residents care about making our area open to families and enabling spending time outdoors in a friendly environment.
We invite you to vote!!!
Come to Partynice!!

Your task is to analyze the following project, proposed as part of a new participatory budgeting election:

Project: Revitalization of Ruska Street
Cost: 750000 €
District: Psie Pole
Description: Justification
The aim of the project is the renovation of Ruska Street (section from Kazimierza Wielkiego to Solny Square), taking into account the high pedestrian traffic in this area - transforming it into a pedestrian route, accessible to bicycles. The transformation seen on Kuźnicza and Oławska Streets could be replicated here, with even greater success anticipated.

Ruska Street needs renovation. It is a route with great potential - it connects a transit hub with the Market Square, and there is room for more attractive services on the ground floors of buildings. Moreover, several underground car parks have been established in the area (Times office building, NFM). Ruska should feature trees and benches, and a suggested bicycle lane could be marked (e.g., with a different shade of pavement).

During the renovation, only pedestrian-friendly surfaces should be used (as seen on Kuźnicza Street, the residents of Wrocław do not accept cobblestones).
*In case the renovation turns out to cost more than 1 million PLN, the first phase should be carried out, e.g., revitalization of part of the indicated street section.

Project: Urban Green Islands
Cost: 250000 €
District: Stare Miasto
Description: Justification
This year, smog has made its presence felt by all residents of Wrocław. Studies have shown that we could breathe clean air for only a few days! The data is alarming. Meanwhile, during the summer, so-called urban heat islands form in our area, causing an artificial increase in temperature compared to the surrounding areas. How can we deal with the negative effects of urbanization? What can be done to make life easier for us, the residents of Wrocław? How can we reduce these negative effects that impact our health? We propose a globally tested system for reducing the negative effects of smog and urban heat islands, which involves installing specialized panels planted with moss and capable of supporting other plants. This project fits perfectly into the concept of Green Wrocław. It is also an excellent idea for originally enhancing urban space. The main function of the panels will be the reduction of air pollution – plants, especially mosses, have the ability to simultaneously absorb many different pollutants from the air, including polluting gases (NOX, CO2, CO, and O3) and suspended particulates. Moss provides an excellent substrate and is resistant to low temperatures. On hot days, the panels lower the temperature through water evaporation. The panels also contribute to noise reduction. The panels have a proper irrigation system that keeps the plants alive, moisturizes the air around the installation, and reduces air dustiness. Mosses are excellent reservoirs of rainwater, thus they are helpful during heavy downpours. The panels have other advantages too - greenery improves mood and reduces stress. Wrocław would be the first city in Poland to boast such a modern and eco-friendly solution.

Project: Pedestrian and bicycle paths along Opatowicka Street.
Cost: 500000 €
District: Krzyki
Description: Justification
Along Opatowicka Street, there are several sections of flood embankments, on top of which are hardened paths. They are perfect for walks, bike rides, and running. Between the ""embanked"" sections, there are no paths separated from the road, allowing for the safe movement of pedestrians, runners, and cyclists. This has been particularly noticeable since the road section between the eastern bypass of Wrocław and Trestno was renovated, which has led to a significant increase in the volume of cars driving on Opatowicka Street. The completed paths would connect the entire loop: the footbridge near the zoo (from the Oder side), embankments along Sępolno, Biskupin, Bartoszewicz, Opatowicka weir, Opatowicka Island, Opatowicka lock, Opatowicka Street, Międzyrzecka Street.

Your task is to analyze the following project, proposed as part of a new participatory budgeting election:

Project: Safer at the intersection of Sobieski Avenue and Wilanowska Street
Cost: 1000000 €
District: Krzyki
Description: Justification
The project aims to improve safety at the exit from al. Sobieskiego onto Zakrzów. This location witnesses numerous accidents (including fatal ones), primarily caused by vehicles from Mirków rear-ending vehicles turning left into ul. Wilanowska. The occurrence of dangerous situations is contributed to by excessive vehicle speeds and long waiting times for turning towards Zakrzów during afternoon hours.

Additionally, there is frequent violation of the no-left-turn rule from ul. Wilanowska towards the city boundary. Often, this maneuver is performed by trucks, resulting in the trailer blocking the road towards the city center.

The forced right of way by vehicles exiting the parking lots on ul. Wilanowska also plays a significant role. This is due to the unintuitive signage and unclear geometry of this part of the intersection.

Since this is the most frequented entrance to our estate and is traversed by bus line 150, the current state of safety at this location is unacceptable to the residents of Zakrzów.

The project scope includes:
- drafting a traffic organization plan that will facilitate the left turn from al. Sobieskiego into ul. Wilanowska, increase the throughput of the left turn, reduce the speed of vehicles heading towards the city center, and prevent exits from ul. Wilanowska towards Mirków
- construction works (introduction of new traffic organization elements and road safety devices, and possible adjustment of the intersection geometry)
- potential installation of speed control devices

We do not provide specific solutions (construction of traffic lights, installation of vibratory lines on the road, installation of speed cameras, etc.), as we believe that the effectiveness of the measures applied is guaranteed only by an analysis of the problem conducted during the project drafting stage.

Project: On foot from Brochów - completion of the missing sidewalk on I. Mościckiego, Gazowa, and Karwińska Streets (mainly concerns the viaduct over the tracks connecting these three streets)
Cost: 1000000 €
District: Krzyki
Description: Justification
From Brochów, it is impossible to leave on foot without walking the streets - there are no sidewalks. Indeed, some time ago, I. Mościckiego Street was widened with a gravel strip, which was probably meant to substitute for a sidewalk but only up to the railway viaduct on Wiaduktowa Street. The aim of the project is to construct safe sidewalks, enabling the residents of Brochów to leave the estate without having to use public transport or cars. Very often, children returning from school use the viaduct connecting I. Mościckiego Street with Gazowa and Karwińska Streets, which is very dangerous because the traffic there is really heavy, and there is virtually no shoulder, while crossing with a child in a stroller is impossible. The project will also include additional lighting over these streets, especially over the pedestrian crossing on I. Mościckiego Street near the bus stops, before the railway viaduct (from the city center side). When driving there at night, it is very difficult to see anyone on these strips because just before them is the last street lamp, and before the driver's eyes adjust to the darkness, they are already past the pedestrian crossings. An accident in this place is easily conceivable.

Project: Honey Meadows in Wrocław
Cost: 100000 €
District: Psie Pole
Description: Justification
The aim of the project is to create an attractive urban space, improve plant diversity, and protect beneficial pollinating insects.
The project concerns four locations: the main one at pl. Wróblewskiego and three smaller ones (Wyspa Słodowa, Pomorska, Gajowicka), where we plan to create an unusual, green enclave.
As part of the development of areas with a total area of almost 12,000 m2, it is planned to plant suitable flowering vegetation, whose blooming period would allow for constant access to pollination for insects and would make this place more attractive during the spring-summer and autumn periods (shrubs are also planned, which diversify the terrain especially in winter). This would allow for the preservation of greenery diversity, and would initiate the protection of valuable pollinating insects in urban spaces, including honey bees, which are dying at an alarming rate, leading to a lack of plant and product diversity.
In developing the project, I collaborated with students from the Student Scientific Circle of Beekeepers ""Apis"" at the University of Environmental and Life Sciences in Wrocław. Their expert knowledge of plants and insects would help in creating honey meadows in Wrocław. In conclusion, I would like to add that the idea is in line with Wrocław's efforts to win the title of European Green Capital in 2019.

Project: Wrocław Sports Arena - Zone A
Cost: 1000000 €
District: Krzyki
Description: Justification
The project envisages the creation of Zone A of the Wrocław Sports Arena located in Zakrzów.
The lack of access to diverse and universally accessible sports and recreational facilities affects a very large number of Wrocław residents. The existing places created for this purpose are overcrowded and insufficiently adapted to the expectations of our city's residents. The deficit of such infrastructure results in a significant portion of Wrocław residents giving up on physical activity. The primary goal of the Sports Arena is to fill the gap in the map of Wrocław's sports and recreational infrastructure by creating a sports center in the northeast part of the city. The layout and selection of facilities for new disciplines at the Sports Arena will make it a unique meeting place for families from all over Wrocław. The project will include:
- a beach volleyball court
- Pumptrack Entry - a track designed for beginner and intermediate cyclists. It will be built using modular technology, so that it can be expanded or reshaped in the future
- a Padel court. Padel is a combination of Squash and Tennis, an ideal family sport with a recreational character. It is not a technical sport, which allows beginner players to quickly reach a level that enables comfortable play
- Expansion of the baseball field with a concrete grandstand set behind the backstop on the left side. This investment will enhance the entire complex and emphasize its unique character.
The project has been consulted with the residents of Wrocław. It meets the needs for activating the society associated with actively spending free time outdoors. Wrocław Sports Arena will also be a venue for national sports events, which will enhance the attractiveness of the sports offer for the city's residents.

Your task is to analyze the following project, proposed as part of a new participatory budgeting election:

Project: Network of parks in Wrocław - Psie Pole - Zawidawie 1
Cost: 1000000 €
District: Fabryczna
Description: Justification
The aim of the project is to create two green areas in the Psie Pole-Zawidawie district - the development of a neglected plot in the LZN area located between Gorlicka Street and Kiełczowska Street, and a recreational area on Zakrzowie on the bank of the Dobra River. Connecting areas located on both sides of Sobieski Avenue aims to activate residents of the entire estate around a common project within the framework of WBO 2017.
The first area in this project is a neglected green plot stretching between the estate at Miłostowska Street, LZN, and the estate at Gorlicka Street. An illuminated bicycle path should be led along its inner or outer edge. In the rows of newly planted trees, there will be a place for recreation and play for the youngest children. It is also important to develop the ""wedge"" from Kiełczowska Street to the end of the LZN fence. This place is easily accessible by a sidewalk built as part of WBO. The reported project also includes the development of the space between the sidewalk and the LZN fence. Along the length of the concrete fence, paving with blocks, and along the length of the metal fence and ""island,"" appropriately selected greenery.
The second location of this project is the area on Zakrzowie, along the bank of the Dobra – from Zakrzowski Bridge to the unpaved road leading to Zakrzów Stadium. An ideal place for a proper path and family relaxation time, e.g., picnics. It is necessary to tidy up the area, designate avenues, build a shelter/s, two or three fire pits, and benches around them.
The beneficiaries will be residents of the surrounding estates, but through the development of a network park, in the future, all Wrocław residents as well.
The project was created as a result of the work of the WBO 2017 Working Group and meetings within the Civic Laboratory in Zawidawie in 2017.

Project: Bike Wrocław 2017
Cost: 1000000 €
District: Stare Miasto
Description: Justification
The project envisages improving the safety and comfort of cyclists on the streets of Wrocław by creating bike lanes or paths, and in cases where space is lacking, calming traffic and painting sergeants (sign P–27) on those streets where cycling infrastructure is missing or incomplete (only on one side of the road or discontinuous).
Proposed locations:
- Borowska – bike lane from Gliniana to Armii Krajowej
- Gliniana – bike path connector between Ślężna and Borowska
- Swobodna – extension of the existing bike path from Powstańców Śląskich to Ślężna and Borowska
- Hubska and Bardzka – one-way bike path on the western side from Gliniana to Armii Krajowej
- Małachowskiego – bike lanes
- Poniatowskiego – sergeants and traffic calming
- Żmigrodzka – bike lane from Kasprowicza to Kępińska

2. At the end, provide only a valid JSON dictionary, with no additional text.";"1. **Project Relevance**: The ""Bike Wrocław 2017"" project addresses a growing demand for improved cycling infrastructure in Wrocław, which is a city with a significant number of cyclists and a commitment to sustainable urban mobility.

2. **Cost and Budget Impact**: The project's cost is 1,000,000 €, which is a substantial amount but still allows for multiple projects to be funded within the total budget of 4,500,000 €. This cost is neither too low to be considered trivial nor too high to exhaust the budget quickly, making it a balanced choice in financial terms.

3. **District Coverage**: The project covers multiple key areas in the Stare Miasto district, which is a central and highly populated area. This broad coverage likely increases the project's appeal to a larger voter base within the district.

4. **Voter Behavior**: In participatory budgeting, projects that impact daily life and offer visible improvements tend to attract more votes. Cycling infrastructure directly affects many residents' daily commutes and leisure activities.

5. **Competition and Comparison**: The project's success also depends on the number and nature of competing proposals in the same election cycle. Assuming a moderate level of competition, a project enhancing urban mobility and safety should perform well.

6. **Historical Data and Trends**: Based on typical participatory budgeting outcomes, projects with a clear, direct benefit to a large number of residents, especially in urban mobility, tend to rank higher in votes.

7. **Estimation of Votes and Rank**: Considering these factors, the project might attract a significant portion of the voting population, particularly those who are regular cyclists or residents of the affected areas. The project's rank would likely be high but not necessarily at the very top, depending on the presence of other compelling projects.

Project: Bike and stroller ramp at the exit from Sopocka Street to the Odra River Embankments
Cost: 50000 €
District: Fabryczna
Description: Justification
The embankments along the Oder, especially the section between the Warsaw Bridges and the Szczytnicki Bridge after the completed revitalization, have become a wonderful place for walks and bike rides.
The aim of the project is to construct a ramp from Sopocka Street, which will allow free access to the cycling and walking paths for residents.
Currently, accessing the cycling and walking paths on the embankments from Sopocka Street is difficult for cyclists, disabled people, and mothers with children due to the lack of a convenient ramp: there are only steep and difficult-to-climb stairs.
Moreover, this passage is very frequently used not only by local residents but also by visitors to the St. Lawrence Cemetery and those traveling to the nearby allotment gardens on Bujwida Street.
Furthermore, the project aligns with the concept of promoting cycling in Wrocław and restoring the river to the city, and is a natural continuation of the recently completed construction of a bicycle passage under the Szczytnicki Bridge.

Project: Sporty Amber
Cost: 1000000 €
District: Krzyki
Description: Justification
In executing the project for the construction of a multifunctional sports field from WBO 2014, we noticed an increase in the sporting potential among the residents of this area; there is hardly an hour when the field built in 2015 is free. Therefore, we decided to expand the sports facilities for the residents of this area by applying for:
a) the construction of a multifunctional field with lines for playing handball, two basketball courts, and a volleyball court at the intersection of Jantarowa and Zaporoska streets on the current premises of LO VIII. The field should have a polyurethane surface and be surrounded by ball catchers.
b) the replacement of the fence along the current Liceum nr VIII and Gimnazjum nr 30, which will become one institution in the future, along with the placement of gates in locations where residents already cross the fence, facilitating entry for all residents.
c) along the inner part of the fence, we propose planting shrubs to reduce the number of people crossing the fences in the future.
d) on the side of Krucza Street, near the field built in 2015, we propose the construction of an outdoor gym adapted for the needs of adults and the elderly.
e) the installation of lighting for sports fields using both solar technology and an SMS-based lighting activation system.
Additionally, we propose the renovation of the sidewalk along Jantarowa Street.
The implementation of the project will increase the attractiveness of the sports base of the estate, enhance the aesthetics of the estate by increasing the existing greenery, and improve the safety of pedestrians moving along Jantarowa.

Project: Boarding at level - construction of Górnicki's Viennese stops
Cost: 500000 €
District: Śródmieście
Description: Justification
Vienna-style stops facilitate boarding for the elderly, disabled, and parents with strollers, and ensure that drivers adhere to speed limits. This solution is increasingly being implemented in the city, including on Hubskiej, Glinianej, Trzebnickiej, and Szczytnickiej streets. The Kleczkowska stop is used by many clients of the nearby Social Insurance Institution (ZUS)—the elderly and disabled, and the elevated entrance greatly facilitates their use of public transport. The Górnickiego stop is located on the busy Sienkiewicza street. Constructing a boarding island will also improve passenger safety.

Your task is to analyze the following project, proposed as part of a new participatory budgeting election:

Project: Green running-walking-cycling trail from Ołtaszyn to the center (with modifications)
Cost: 750000 €
District: Krzyki
Description: Justification
I propose several modifications (mainly cost-reducing) to this project so that it is feasible and fits within the planned budget:
1. The route passes through several districts (originally 3) and for this reason, I classify this project as city-wide with a higher budget.
2. Shortening the route - running from the renovated Parafialna Street through Orawska and Spiska to Skowroni Park. Only if further financing is obtained or larger funds are utilized, do I propose extending it through Spiska Street to the Aquapark or further.
3. Replacing the asphalt surface with a smooth, compacted gravel surface. This change:
a) lowers costs
b) is healthier and more comfortable for runners and equivalent for cyclists
c) allows car drivers access to allotment gardens while simultaneously reducing the speed of access compared to an asphalt road, thereby improving the safety of pedestrians, runners, and cyclists.
d) maintains the recreational character of the path in terms of physical activity for pedestrians, runners, and cyclists without turning it into an asphalt, congested access road and a shortcut and alternative route for cars for the congested Grota-Roweckiego Street.

Project: Green Promenade through Krzyki Stage I
Cost: 1000000 €
District: Krzyki
Description: Justification
The project aims to restore the historical urban layout by revalorizing the promenade stretching from the intersection of Zaporoska and Grabiszyńska streets, crowned with the historic water tower at Aleja Wiśniowa. We propose to reclaim the aesthetic values of the original green artery concept, combined with the communication needs of this part of the district. The street, outlined in the late 19th century, is an example of a beautiful visual axis dominated by the water tower from 1904, a monument to good urban planning, additionally serving as a green corridor of the area. With minimal resources, we can restore the luster of the former promenade while organizing and improving pedestrian, vehicular, and bicycle traffic on this section. The work performed could potentially mark the beginning of further changes towards Grabiszyńska Street. The primary task of the project is to improve the aesthetics of the area, the quality of life of the residents, and to connect a convenient pedestrian and bicycle route along the entire section of the green artery from landmarks such as the water tower and the Jewish Hospital, now housing the Railway Hospital, further to the Roman Catholic Parish of St. Augustine, Hans Poelzig's tenements, up to the Rondo of the Silesian Insurgents.

Project: Lounger - a wandering piece of furniture for rest and play
Cost: 150000 €
District: Śródmieście
Description: Justification
The ""Polegiwacz"" is a portable furniture-installation designed for relaxation, fun, and social integration. The prototype of this facility operated over the past three seasons in two different locations in Wrocław: in Słowacki Park and near the Zwierzyniecka Footbridge. Three seasons have shown that the furniture is eagerly used by various age and social groups. The facility hosted many events, concerts, meetings, classes, and even at least one wedding session. Contrary to its name, children used it not for lounging but as an attractive playground.

The location planned for the first season - Polskie Hill - was chosen as a distinctive point along the walking route of Wrocław's promenades. The proximity to the newly opened X. Dunikowski Boulevard attracts many residents and visitors - including many families. Last year's observations and analyses showed that an element that could complement the local program is a playground for children (the nearest playgrounds are on Bielarska Island and near the Puppet Theatre) who often get bored during walks and use existing landscaping elements for play.

The ""Polegiwacz"" on Polskie Hill would excellently combine the possibility of relaxation for the older with the opportunity for activity for the youngest.

Its dual function as both a relaxation spot and a play area increases its appeal across different age groups.

2. **Location**: The choice of Polskie Hill, a prominent and frequented area, enhances the project's visibility and accessibility, likely increasing voter interest.

3. **Cost**: At 150,000 €, the project is moderately priced, which might make it more likely to be funded within the available budget of 4,500,000 €, compared to more expensive proposals.

4. **Historical Voting Patterns**: Typically, projects that cater to a broad demographic and provide clear, tangible benefits tend to perform well in participatory budgeting contexts.

5. **District**: Śródmieście is a central district with a high population density, which could translate to a higher number of local supporters who are directly impacted by the project.

Project: Bees in the city – pollinator hotels with a resting area between Hermanowska and Chociebuska streets
Cost: 250000 €
District: Krzyki
Description: Justification
Currently, the indicated park, although well-maintained, does not serve a recreational or communicative function. Overgrown with old trees (including honey-producing ones), and crisscrossed by worn paths, the area invites organization and the creation of alleys that would connect Kuźniki with Gądów Mały, the establishment of a thematic flower meadow that would benefit beneficial insects, and through the installation of deck chairs and comfortable benches, it would become a place of rest for residents of nearby estates. To diversify the park, I propose the installation of about 20 beehives along with bee families. The area is safely distant from the nearest houses, so the insects would not pose a threat to the residents. The maintenance of the beehives would be handled by specialized units such as beekeeping clubs, and the delicious Kuźnicki Honey would be auctioned at the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity.

This could attract a significant number of environmentally conscious voters.

2. **Cost and Budget Considerations**: The project cost of 250,000 € is moderate compared to the total available budget of 4,500,000 €. This makes it financially feasible and likely to be funded if it receives enough votes, without exhausting the budget.

3. **District Impact**: The project is located in the Krzyki district, one of the more populous districts of Wroclaw. Projects that impact a larger number of residents directly often receive more votes due to the direct benefits perceived by the voters.

4. **Unique Proposition**: The inclusion of beekeeping and the creation of a thematic flower meadow are unique and specific propositions that can distinguish this project from others that might focus on more general improvements.

5. **Community Involvement**: The involvement of local beekeeping clubs and the auctioning of honey for charity could increase community support and participation, thereby boosting the number of votes.

6. **Voting Dynamics**: Typically, projects that are well-defined, have a clear benefit to the community, and involve environmental sustainability tend to perform well in participatory budgeting settings.

Project: The base of little astronauts, or the cosmic playground in Mini Park on F. Hynka Street.
Cost: 1000000 €
District: Krzyki
Description: Justification
As part of the Civic Budget of 2015, the indicated plot was organized and now encourages the development of a section for the youngest residents of the Kosmonautów Estate.
The base of little astronauts is a modern playground complex that will fulfill children's dreams of being astronauts and traveling to distant planets and galaxies. The base is designed to prepare little astronauts for space journeys, simultaneously developing their motor skills and imagination. The complex includes: a large space station, a training base, the Mercury agility set, and the Cosmic Surfer. These devices feature, among others, a group of linear obstacles, climbing walls, towers of various heights, tunnels, slides, and ladders, as well as a cosmic device designer. These devices are classified as difficult-to-access equipment, intended for school-aged children.
For the youngest children, a smaller cosmic set is planned, including dragonfly-type swings, pendulum swings, and rockers. There will also be a sandbox, benches, and drawing boards as perfect complementary elements of the playground, allowing children to demonstrate their artistic talents. The entire area designated for the playground should be fenced. Due to the lack of a local spatial development plan, it is worth analyzing the reclassification of the above area from a building plot to a plot designated for park greenery.

Project: Cleaning of the sandstone medallions with the coat of arms of Wrocław from war-time grime and soot on old school buildings, hospitals, and other public buildings.
Cost: 150000 €
District: Krzyki
Description: Justification
Medallions with the coat of arms of Wrocław are unique in the country - cleaned of wartime soot and dirt, they serve as decoration and a tourist attraction, for example, two cleaned medallions on the facade of the Market Hall, a cleaned medallion on the building of the Primary School at Kleczkowska Street, the facade of the Ninth High School, the building of the First High School at Poniatowskiego Street. The proposal involves sandblasting these medallions with pressurized water from a boom lift. The cost is about several thousand złoty per piece, but cleaning 10 pieces would be cheaper.
Known addresses of these gems:
> MSWiA Hospital from Pl. Powstańców Wlkp. and from the railway tracks - 2 pieces
> Post-secondary School for Cultural Animator Training, Building A from J. Niemcewicza Street
> University of Wrocław - three buildings on Dawida Street - 3 pieces
> Primary School No. 73, Gliniana Street on the side from Gajowa Street.
> Post-secondary School, Trzebnicka Street from the side of Dębicki.
Residents of Wrocław probably know other locations of these medallions - the city's calling cards.

Once the voting period ends, the projects are ranked according to the number of votes received. Then, the winning projects are selected using a greedy algorithm: starting with the project that received the most votes, projects are added one by one in decreasing order of votes, as long as the available budget allows. If the next project in the list exceeds the remaining budget, it is skipped in favor of the next affordable one, and so on, until the total budget of 4500000 € is exhausted.
Your task is to analyze the following project, proposed as part of a new participatory budgeting election:

Project: Neptune's Fountain at Nowy Targ Square
Cost: 1000000 €
District: Śródmieście
Description: Justification
The reconstruction of the historical Neptune sculpture at Nowy Targ Square, destroyed during World War II. In its current form, the square lacks a central point that completes the composition. The dark surfaces of which the square is built accumulate heat during hot days, and the fountain would also prevent this, which would also improve user comfort. One could consider holding a competition for a contemporary, figurative version of Neptune inspired by the historical sculpture.
The project would be divided into stages. This stage would only include the cost of starting the carving of the fountain, and the second stage would involve the construction of the entire basin and the necessary infrastructure.

Based on:
- Your knowledge of Wroclaw, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges
- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)
- The typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections

Project: Let's connect Psie Pole and Zakrzów – a pedestrian and bicycle link
Cost: 350000 €
District: Stare Miasto
Description: Justification
The project envisages the construction of a pedestrian and bicycle route connecting Kiełczowska Street with Bierutowska, Dobroszycka, Armii Ludowej Streets, and the Wrocław Psie Pole train station. This route will allow the residents of Psie Pole to quickly reach the train or the clinic on Bierutowska Street on foot or by bicycle, and the residents of Zakrzów through Armii Ludowej Street to the LZN area. In this way, we will facilitate the movement between two Wrocław housing estates, which are close to each other but have been separated by the railway line and industrial areas.

Every day, many people, mainly on bicycles, move along a muddy, gravel path between the remnants of allotment gardens and industrial areas. In the local spatial development plan, a narrow strip connecting Kiełczowska Street with Bierutowska is marked as an internal road. The width of the land strip (from 5 to 6 m) does not allow for the construction of a street of greater significance for intra-estate communication. Therefore, I propose to develop this piece of space differently – to build a comfortable route for pedestrians and cyclists hidden in the shade of trees that have already grown there.

Route parameters: width 3 m, asphalt surface
Route components:
•	pedestrian and bicycle path Kiełczowska – Bierutowska
•	renovation of the sidewalk at Bierutowska Street
•	pedestrian crossing and bicycle crossing through Bierutowska Street with a refuge in the roadway and additional lighting
•	pedestrian and bicycle path Bierutowska – Dobroszycka (under the viaduct along Jan III Sobieski Avenue)
•	pedestrian crossing and bicycle crossing through Dobroszycka Street with additional lighting
•	renovation of the sidewalk at Dobroszycka Street along with a pedestrian crossing and bicycle crossing through Armii Ludowej Street (at the railway crossing) and additional lighting

Your task is to analyze the following project, proposed as part of a new participatory budgeting election:

Project: Bus stop infrastructure on Dworcowa Street
Cost: 420000 €
District: Stare Miasto
Description: Justification
The bus loop at Dworcowa Street (from which, among other destinations, buses depart to the airport) is in very poor condition with old stops, a limited number of benches, and a sidewalk surface in bad shape (uneven concrete slabs that are very uncomfortable to walk on, especially in winter). Additionally, the bus schedules are very unclear as they are divided among individual stops, making it difficult for someone not from Wrocław to navigate. This place creates an unfavorable image of the city, and a large number of people arriving in Wrocław (including tourists) come into contact with it, especially when someone arrives in Wrocław using public transport to get to the airport.
It would suffice to replace the sidewalk surface, refresh or install new bus shelters (3-4), possibly trash bins, install benches, refresh or replace the bus stop poles, and possibly add 2-3 new street lamps.
I classify this project as city-wide, as it is used by a large portion of Wrocław's residents and visitors, and this place influences the image and perception of the city.
