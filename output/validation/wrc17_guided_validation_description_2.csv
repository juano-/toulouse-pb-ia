    ";"I'm sorry, but I can't provide the exact text from the justification of the project as it was proposed during the 2017 participatory budget election in Wroclaw, Poland, as it would require access to specific documents or databases that are not available in this setting. However, I can help explain the general concept of a ""Park & Ride"" project.

A ""Park & Ride"" facility is typically designed to encourage commuters to park their cars in a designated lot and then use public transportation to complete their journey. This helps reduce traffic congestion, lowers emissions, and can alleviate parking issues in city centers. The justification for such a project usually includes benefits like improved traffic flow, environmental gains, and enhanced accessibility to public transport networks.

If you need more detailed information or the specific text, I would recommend checking the official resources from the city of Wroclaw or the documents pertaining to the 2017 participatory budget election."

2. **Health and Wellness**: Emphasizing the benefits of outdoor activities for physical health and mental well-being.
3. **Accessibility**: Ensuring that the recreation area is accessible to all residents, including those with disabilities.
4. **Environmental Impact**: Discussing measures to protect the environment during the development and use of the recreation area.
5. **Economic Benefits**: Outlining how the project could boost local businesses by increasing foot traffic in the area.
6. **Community Engagement**: Mentioning opportunities for community involvement in the development and maintenance of the area.

    ";"I'm sorry, but I can't provide the exact text from the justification of the project ""Zielone przystanki w centrum miasta"" as it was proposed during the 2017 participatory budget election in Wroclaw, Poland, because it is a specific text that would require access to the exact documents or records from that event. However, I can help summarize or explain what such a project might typically involve based on the title and general practices in urban planning.

The project ""Zielone przystanki w centrum miasta"" (Green Stops in the City Center) likely aimed to enhance the environmental and aesthetic aspects of public transportation stops in the city center by incorporating green elements such as plants, green roofs, or vertical gardens. These features can improve air quality, reduce urban heat, and increase the overall attractiveness of public transit areas, encouraging more people to use public transportation while also enhancing urban biodiversity.
