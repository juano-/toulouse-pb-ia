136;2022;Bike lane on Saint-Exupéry Avenue;When you live near Place de l'Ormeau, cycling into town is dangerous. Wouldn't it be possible to consider creating a proper bike lane there? The need exists because there is the Anatole France college at the bottom of the avenue. A secure bike path would allow middle school students to cycle. Since the avenue is narrow, could a one-way system not be considered for Avenue Saint-Exupéry and Avenue Jean Rieux? Implementation details - Technical opinion: Improvement of cycling facilities on Avenue Saint-Exupéry. These transitional arrangements will eventually be replaced by the Agglomeration Cycling Network.
7;2022;Create dedicated and well-defined bike and pedestrian paths;"To promote cohabitation between pedestrians and cyclists, create dedicated and well-defined lanes for each. This includes Alsace Lorraine Street where cohabitation is really complicated and dangerous. And implement measures to ensure these are respected, with reminders if necessary.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Dedicating spaces to cyclists or pedestrians separately echoes increasing demands, and ongoing development projects tend to take them into account. This is the case for the redevelopment of Metz Street and the Rive Droite-Rive Gauche project.

Alsace Lorraine Street presents two distinct profiles: an area with a traffic lane for vehicles and a central square without motor vehicle traffic.

Currently, cyclists predominantly use the central lane designated for automobile traffic.

A pedestrian/cycle separation can be experimented with for 6 months, using yellow markings with bike logos and chevrons in the center of the road and marked counterflow (similar to the concept of a bike street). Repeating the logos every 20 meters will allow clear visualization by pedestrians.

If this experiment leads to an improvement in terms of pedestrian/cycle usage conflicts, a permanent arrangement can be considered."
5;2022;Greening of the Place du Capitole;"To add even more majesty to this iconic location in the pink city, this square could be surrounded by greenery: planting of trees, containers... Implementation details - Technical opinion: The development of the Place du Capitole is limited due to a number of constraints:
- presence of an underground parking lot over much of the square, preventing full-ground plantings,
- a location in a protected sector, thus requiring prior compliant opinion from the Architecte des Bâtiments de France,
- numerous events and uses on the square necessitating the maintenance of a surface free of any obstacles.
However, it is possible to deploy square planters of 1.5m by 1.5m or 2m by 2m made of ""Corten"" type steel allowing for the planting of trees. These planters could be placed along the facade of the Capitole to emphasize the rhythm of this building. Additional placements on either side of the square are also conceivable."
132;2022;Mosquito Control;Installation of mosquito traps in the Pont des Demoiselles neighborhood: Mosquitoes are captured by suction using traps/stations (sealers) made in France that mimic human scent. This is an environmentally friendly system. Implementation details - Technical notice: Installation of three “anti-mosquito” stations within the Pont des Demoiselles neighborhood. These stations combine two factors: 1) The slow release of CO² 2) Volatile organic compounds. In addition to their effectiveness, these stations also have the advantage of respecting biodiversity. They will be placed near public facilities.
71;2022;Plant trees and shared gardens wherever possible!;"A neighbor is using a piece of land from the local supermarket to plant seeds and shrubs with their approval; it's private property but visible to everyone. I think the idea is excellent. Why not ""requisition"" all accessible plots of land and plant trees, flowers, vegetables, and let the neighborhood residents take care of them? I believe we need to plant as many trees as possible to help the city maintain lower temperatures, reduce our consumption, make the city more beautiful, and additionally, it could allow us to harvest fruits and vegetables for those who do not have a garden or enough space, or who cannot afford to buy fruits and vegetables. Les Minimes was agricultural land, the soil is rich.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The Community has launched a Tree Plan since 2019, with nearly 20,000 trees already planted since then. This idea is therefore feasible on public spaces and to implement it, it will be necessary to work in partnership with neighborhood associations on citizen greening projects to find suitable sites. It will then be appropriate to carry out a diagnostic for urban plantings, always because of the networks. Regarding food cultivation, this idea can be part of creating a shared garden, especially in the context of the upcoming redevelopment of the Bourbaki neighborhood, with public consultations expected to start from 2023."
34;2022;Pedestrian redevelopment, bicycle lanes, and greening of Charles de Fitte avenues;"Charles de Fitte Alley could use some simple modifications to encourage and facilitate its use by pedestrians and cyclists, especially in the section between Fer-à-Cheval and Place Saint-Cyprien. Currently, buses, cars, and trucks dominate this road, while pedestrians weave through each other and various kinds of litter on sidewalks that are too narrow. As for cyclists, they face the threat of buses and the reckless overtaking by irritated motorcyclists or drivers. My proposals: 1) reworked and better-identified ground markings so that everyone can find their place safely. 2) redefined and more efficient parking zones. For example, by creating angled parking zones, rather than along the edges of sidewalks. 3) always more trees and greenery, especially around the clinic/maternity ward, for the delight of these newborns and their parents.

Implementation modalities - Technical opinion:
Temporarily redesign Charles de Fitte alleys to facilitate, clarify, and standardize the cycling connections by adjusting the bus and bike lanes. This is only a tactical arrangement since these alleys have been identified as a structural axis of the express bike network and will therefore undergo more significant development in the coming years. Also, greening of the lateral islands between existing trees will be carried out if the project is approved."
115;2022;A sports complex in an urban area;We are a group of young friends, most of us having lived in the Soupetard neighborhood since childhood. We usually meet weekly for sports activities. We've noticed a decline in enthusiasm and civic initiatives in our neighborhood, and today we want to revitalize it through a useful and interesting project for our living environment, especially for different generations. Our project aims to build a sports complex. It will be a Five, a field the size of a city stadium but not the same. It is an enclosed area with synthetic grass and safety railings, delighting those who play 5-a-side football. The outdoor Five is a sport played according to specific rules, unlike football on city stadiums, which is much less regulated and taken less seriously by its players. This project aims to improve the image of the Soupetard neighborhood, to breathe new life into it by creating opportunities for fulfillment for residents, especially the youth. Our goals are: - to promote sports among the youth, - to enhance the Soupetard La Gloire neighborhood, - to enable young people to get involved in their neighborhood, - to improve social connections through football, - to animate the neighborhood and social cohesion, - to open the neighborhood to the rest of the metropolis, - to provide more practical and local access to sports facilities, - to create intergenerational cohesion and diversity, - to bring security and stability around the practice of football, - to provide access to quality facilities for everyone and for actors in the eastern sector, - to ensure that the youth are not wandering aimlessly, - to channel the energy of the youth. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: The project is very interesting to meet the long-expressed needs of the neighborhood's youth. It is technically feasible. The sports department has reservations about the proposed location (within Soupetard school) due to the risk of noise pollution generated by this type of equipment and considering its proximity to residential areas. If the idea wins during the residents' vote, a consultation with the local residents will be organized. If there is strong opposition from the residents about the location proposed by the project leader, another location will be proposed for its realization: at the Soupetard garden, on the concrete esplanade below Boulevard Jacques Chirac.
177;2022;Land covered at the level of the boulodrome;This idea was submitted via a paper form by Bouliste. Construction of an indoor boulodrome that can be used by Ferdinand school, the seniors' club, CLAE, or all associations. Request currently pending with the town hall. Implementation details - Technical opinion: The proposal for a covered area must allow for the playing of pétanque and basketball. The covered surface will house a boules court that can be made available for other events. The uncovered part will be reserved for a 3x3 basketball court.
19;2022;Motion sensor night lighting;"I propose public lighting with motion sensors for nighttime use. The streetlights are turned off at night and only activate upon detecting movement for a few minutes - ensuring safety. This could be implemented on the greenway (Amidonniers), among other places. This system is already being tested in some municipalities in France (in Haute-Vienne, for example). It allows for cost savings and improves the onset and quality of sleep for both humans and birds (see studies on the subject). The investment is low and the implementation quick, with a clear return on investment both financially and in terms of citizen well-being. I hope this idea will be considered, thank you!

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The embedded intelligence in public lighting is the ""smart"" solution for lighting and consuming just enough, while preserving wildlife and flora. However, the technical solution of ""presence"" detection by infrared radar is not optimal: this technique does not provide a sufficient guarantee of detection over time and space (external thermal environments do not allow for reliable detection in case of summer heat, which negates the expected positive effect on wildlife and flora).

The system in use in the municipality of Toulouse is based on the detection of human ""shapes,"" providing light only when there is actual use of the public space. The detection of shape refers to moving human forms.

This system has been in service since 2018 on 2000 devices in the city of Toulouse and is planned to be expanded in the coming years."
156;2022;Develop the Rond-Point des Français Libres and the Demoiselles - Mistral - Frizac - Duméril - St Joseph intersection.;"1/ Reduce the excessive paved area and vegetate the reclaimed space 2/ Improve the traffic plan of this intersection (allée des Demoiselles - allées Mistral - avenue Frizac - rues St Joseph and Duméril) 3/ Create a bike path from allée des Demoiselles to rue Duméril

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Redevelopment of the Rond Point des Français Libres and improvement of the Demoiselles-Mistral-Frizac-Duméril-Saint-Joseph intersection: vegetation, addressing bike path discontinuities, and enhanced security of the intersection."
9;2022;Penalize Noisy Bikers;"I would like to raise awareness among our biker friends about reducing noise in the city. Controls based on prevention would enforce the law, which ranges between 66dB and 80dB depending on the engine size. I know that sound radars will soon be tested, but simple compliance and a strategic location in the city (at the intersection of Metz and Languedoc) would allow law enforcement to quickly reduce the noise from the hundred bikers who ride in the city center with non-standard noise.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Currently, there is no radar equipment capable of penalizing vehicle noise. However, it is possible to install an educational radar which, with the help of a luminous panel, would indicate to drivers whether the noise level emitted by their motor vehicle is compliant or not.
Operating cost: 5,000 euros per year."
163;2022;Reopening of the green spaces along the Garonne to the people of Toulouse;"With the covid crisis, no less than 2 hectares of green spaces along the Garonne were closed to the public near the CCAS retirement home in Ducis; these green spaces include wooded areas, lawns, a pond, and the banks of the Garonne with several protected species present. Currently, in the neighborhood, the nearest public green space is either the Barry garden (1km away) or the Raymond VI gardens (2km away), while our neighborhood along the Garonne has many unexploited green space potentials for the residents, including Ducis park (the Roman arenas or the park around the Château de la Flambère can also be mentioned). The goal would be to open the site at the intersection of two neighborhoods, Ancely and Casselardit, with four objectives: - to recreate social links between the residents of the EPHAD and the families/children frequenting the park - to bring an ambition in terms of development (re-greening the space)/management of the park (proposing more extensive management) - to enhance the ecological value of the park included in the green and blue network of the metropolis, which can be integrated into the grand Garonne park and can be valued as a compensation site in the context of local development projects - to raise awareness among nearby schools/residents about biodiversity and the consideration of nature in the city of the Metropolis Among the ideas that could be implemented: - partially replace the weekly mowing of green spaces with extensive mowing/grazing favorable to species of open environments such as eco-grazing - plant trees in targeted sectors to create areas arranged for residents (picnic, relaxation...) as well as cool islands - plant country hedges on the side of Casselardit avenue to isolate the park from the avenue - check for the presence of bats in the castle's attics and propose management monitoring measures (night cameras) - create a shared garden between the school and EPHAD - create a bird-watching area (great cormorant, heron...) between the castle and the Garonne - create a wooden playground, with balance trails To achieve this, a baseline study of the site with the participation of residents/school/EHPAD residents, discovering the unsuspected biodiversity of the park would be necessary. This site fits perfectly into the metropolitan policy in favor of biodiversity (green and blue network / intergenerational citizen participation / 100,000 trees...) This site is also located along a well-frequented cycling path and the GR86. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: A planting program on this site is already established with the choice of species and planting locations. These plantings will be carried out in the fall. The opening to the public of part of the park must respect the constraints related to the reception of the EPHAD residents (health and safety reasons). The installations proposed in this idea must be studied in terms of the cost of purchasing the land."
38;2022;Massive greening of Roguet/St Cyprien square;"Roguet/St Cyprien Square, a nerve center of the neighborhood, a commercial, trading, and residential area, suffers from a significant lack of greenery. It is also a major traffic hub. During the increasingly frequent scorching summers, crossing the square can sometimes be a challenge, as the mineral surface stores and reflects heat. Unfortunately, the few improvements made to the square are insufficient to make it livable. A massive greening of the square would significantly reduce the temperature, dampen traffic noise, and purify the atmosphere.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Greening of Roguet Square, with the installation of planted beds, while maintaining the current uses of the square (terraces, market...). This project will be refined based on technical constraints due to the presence of underground networks.

Regarding the inner Saint-Cyprien Square, this project requires more comprehensive reflection in connection with the integration of the future Express Vélo on the Charles de Fitte alleys, and the cost of development is significantly higher than €200,000, so a comprehensive project has been ruled out from the study. However, vegetated totems (see a reference example by clicking here) can be deployed in the most mineral areas to cool the square."
17;2022;Fighting mosquitoes with bats;Bats could eat up to the equivalent of 3000 insects per night (including mosquitoes). Could we establish bat houses and repopulate with bats in parks to benefit from their cleaning? Implementation details - Technical opinion: Bats are active during twilight or at night, whereas tiger mosquitoes particularly bite during the day (morning and early evening before nightfall). This solution is part of biodiversity preservation and the ecosystem-based approach, but it is not the most appropriate for combating the tiger mosquito. Other solutions such as oviposition traps should be prioritized because they target a key and unavoidable stage in the life cycle of the tiger mosquito and are specific to this species. Therefore, the installation of oviposition traps is proposed as an alternative. In the Compans-Amidonniers district, 40 oviposition traps can be installed.
77;2022;Make Place Amat Massot... a friendly ECO-CITIZEN square!;"Transforming Amat Massot square into a green area, bringing back plant and animal biodiversity, and making it a place of life and meeting for the neighborhood's residents are the goals of our project! Currently, Amat Massot square lacks maintenance. It primarily serves as a spot for illegal parking, the ground and furniture (a few benches) are worn out, and it is regularly invaded by trash and dog droppings, making this space unpleasant, underused, and squatted. However, due to its location (near a middle school, high school, clinic, nursing home, future metro line) and the trees already planted, it has great potential and is just waiting to be enhanced!

Our proposal:
1. Rehabilitate the square
   - Rehabilitate the stabilized (non-asphalted, non-grassed) grounds
   - Replace and supplement the furniture
   - Install a dispenser for dog waste bags (trash bins are already available)
   - Define the square's boundaries and combat illegal parking by installing planters and vegetated posts
   - Incorporate bicycle racks

2. Bring back plant and animal biodiversity
   - Create flower beds by mixing species and varieties of plantings to ensure biodiversity
   - Install birdhouses, especially for tits, which will help control mosquitoes
   - Integrate an insect hotel that would be built during a workshop led by the Collective (a project already carried out by members of the collective in a neighborhood school)
   - Set up a dwelling for hedgehogs, which are very common in the neighborhood

3. Recreate a place for intergenerational life and meeting
   - Integrate a few community garden plots that the Collective commits to maintaining through gardening workshops
   - Place a book exchange box
   - Provide a chess table
   - If the city hall allows it and confirms feasibility, propose to customize benches with nature-themed mosaics

We are at your disposal to present the project in more detail, including sharing a draft model with you!

Implementation modalities - Technical opinion:
A study can be conducted by the competent municipal and metropolitan services to transform this space into a neighborhood square by creating meeting spaces between neighbors and enhancing its vegetal character. A consultation would then be launched with the project initiator, neighborhood associations, and the residents of the concerned neighborhood."
39;2022;Trees for Rue de la République (greening Place Olivier);"The Rue de la République and Place Olivier are so bare.. It's a pity because there is no shade, the concrete retains heat and generates such strong thermal inertia in the summer. It's a busy street for cars and it also heats up due to all the engines passing through. Adding vegetation would be a way to provide some cover from the sun but also to breathe better on this street and square, which are just waiting to become pleasant.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Increase the vegetation around the bases of trees in Place Olivier, to make this area more permeable and reduce temperatures during periods of intense heat. Through the use of grassy paving stones, the plants could blend into the current pavement.

Regarding Rue de la République, vegetation is planned and has been integrated into the redevelopment project aimed at securing pedestrian and cyclist traffic and better connecting the Left Bank to the Right Bank. It will therefore not be studied in the context of this call for ideas."
110;2022;Renovation of the Parc des Argoulets 🌳🌱🌺🌻;"Les Argoulets is a park that lacks vegetation. It is well-attended and in my opinion, it is not sufficiently equipped and not pretty. Making it more pleasant by adding vegetation to improve air quality due to its proximity to the ring road, installing more sports facilities including ping pong tables, renovating the children's park, adding more facilities for napping, reading, picnics, and promoting the planting of flora for bees. 🐝 The park remains a large green space that is not fully utilized, which I find regrettable. Let's develop this little piece of nature by doing good for the environment and our senses.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The installation of ping pong tables is possible, and it is also planned to create a skatepark and a pumptrack at the beginning of 2023. Regarding the plantings, it is possible to plant trees while taking into account the uses of the site to preserve the eco-grazing area. However, since the playground is in good condition, it is not deemed necessary to renovate it. The cost varies depending on the number of plantings."
69;2022;Remove the asphalt from Lombez Avenue and Grande-Bretagne Avenue.;"Lombez Avenue and Grande Bretagne Avenue are busy gateways to the city, with adjacent neighborhoods that have developed significantly. It would be interesting to make these strategic access routes more pleasant by greening the surroundings, flowering all the roundabouts (as is done closer to the city center), creating relaxation areas (benches), play areas, removing the numerous graffiti, eliminating billboards, harmonizing street furniture (sometimes green, sometimes gray, sometimes degraded...), and developing bicycle lanes... There is no shortage of ideas, but it is necessary to make these gateways to the center more pleasant for those who are just passing through, but especially for those who live there. Thank you.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Green the central median of Lombez Avenue by freeing the bases of trees, which will improve the growth conditions of the existing Chinese pear trees, combat heat islands, and beautify this axis to make it more pleasant. Also, on Grande Bretagne Avenue, the concrete blocks preventing access to Charpak Street could be temporarily replaced by planters pending a permanent arrangement. Regarding Grande Bretagne Avenue, this option has been set aside for now because a rapid bike network (REV) project is planned on this axis to improve cyclist movement, and plantings will only be carried out once the arrangements are in place to avoid damaging the plantings. For your information, Lombez Avenue is also identified as an axis of the REV to improve bicycle traffic. Regarding play areas, this issue is being studied as part of the future park located on the third phase of the Cartoucherie along Grande Bretagne Avenue."
157;2022;Tree planting and diversification of the plant palette;"Saint Roch Street features a variable roadway width without shade. A green framework would provide appreciated shading and a more harmonious living environment. It seems possible to plant some remarkable trees as opportunities arise and to diversify the plant palette of the neighborhood. - Planting flowering trees such as Paulownia would contrast with the very large trees on Avenue de l'URSS. (""Imperial tree,"" is a tree native to central China. It grows quickly but does not exceed 10 to 12 meters in height (thus suitable for small gardens), and its spreading form is very elegant.) - Planting perennial plants at the base of shrubbery clusters would be a response to the search for biodiversity and fertile habitat. The cluster located on the north facade could be enriched by some tall shrubs/small trees such as Elderberry. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: Greening of Saint Roch Street through tree planting. Perennial plants will be planted at the base of the trees to provide a fertile habitat for urban biodiversity. The proposal to plant Paulownia species, which have high environmental and aesthetic value, is not suitable for the profile of this street. Species such as “Chinese Pear,” “White Serviceberry,” or “Lutèce Elm” would more adequately address the greening of this road (subject to compatibility with underground networks). Note that such a greening project will impact the on-street parking availability, which should be evaluated before implementation."
118;2022;Development for La Plaine;It would be very useful to have toilets worthy of the name in the green zone of La Plaine and generally in the area extending to Les Argoulets. Implementation details - Technical opinion: This project is feasible, and if this idea wins, it is proposed to experiment with dry toilets in the green zone of Les Argoulets.
44;2022;Swift and bat nesting boxes + traps for tiger mosquito larvae or adults;"To limit the impact of mosquitoes (tiger mosquitoes and others), I propose boosting the population of their natural predators by installing nesting boxes in neighborhoods, or even distributing them to residents for installation. Traps for larvae or adults should be installed to maximize efforts against these pests. Join the proposal from ""Citoyen"" for district 3.3. This proposal should be generalized across all districts, especially in parks and green spaces. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Installation of 40 breeding traps and a swallow nesting box in the district to combat tiger mosquitoes. Bat boxes are less relevant because bats are active at dusk or at night, and tiger mosquitoes particularly bite during the day (morning and early evening before nightfall); thus, they are not the most effective predators against these mosquitoes."
144;2022;Fruit tree plantations in the Rangueil, Sauzelong, and Jules Julien neighborhoods;"I propose planting fruit trees in Toulouse and its surrounding area. In addition to filtering the polluted city air, this will attract bees and other important insects. The trees will provide cool shade and allow those out for a stroll to enjoy an apple, pear, or other fruits. The roots cause much less, if any, deformation to roads and sidewalks. They can be placed in parks, along sidewalks, in public gardens, parking lots, etc. Having experimented with this in Aquitaine, it's a project that works, is well-received, and deserves careful consideration and implementation. Thank you.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Planting about fifty fruit trees in urban areas across the Jules Julien, Midi, Rangueil, Sauzelong neighborhoods."
102;2022;Increase the number of sources of freshness and CO2 capture in the neighborhood;"- in all public green spaces, even very small areas currently not vegetated: planting of shrubs that are easy to maintain and not very water-demanding: althea, lycianthes, Japanese kerria, buddleia, oleander... - flower beds in parks: favor the installation of flowers from bulbs and perennials rather than uprooting flowers (often not yet wilted) and then replanting them: economic, ecological cost, water usage, and mobilization of human resources that could be deployed on tree planting actions, for example - in parks: leave areas unmowed to promote wildlife, diversity, and limit water evaporation - encourage residents to green their balconies: create two events around November 25 (""Everything Takes Root"") and at the beginning of spring to offer tips for planting, plant pairing, water management, and free cuttingsImplementation modalities - Technical opinion: It is possible to plant trees and de-pave several sites in the neighborhood."
72;2022;Mosquito Repellent - Distributing Bat Houses;"To continue the fight against mosquitoes, the idea would be to distribute bat houses that residents can install at their homes. The mode of operation would be similar to the distribution of composters already in place. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Bat houses are less relevant because bats are active at dusk or at night, and tiger mosquitoes particularly bite during the day (morning and early evening before nightfall); thus, they are not the most effective predators for combating these mosquitoes. This solution must be used pragmatically. It is part of the preservation of biodiversity and the ecosystem-based approach but it is not the most appropriate for fighting the tiger mosquito. Other solutions such as oviposition traps should be prioritized because they target a key and unavoidable stage in the life cycle of the tiger mosquito and are specific to this species. Therefore, the implementation of oviposition traps is proposed as an alternative. However, caution is advised if the bat houses were to be proposed for private spaces because this measure must be adopted by the City Council to be implemented on a widespread basis throughout the Toulouse territory.

Cost per bat house: 30 euros. / Cost per oviposition trap = 30 euros for 2

For all of Toulouse (intended for individuals) = 60,000 euros."
153;2022;Reduction of Light Pollution;"Following the example of the new lighting in Busca Square and Frizac Avenue, equipping the streets of the neighborhood leading to Busca Square with LED streetlights that illuminate only towards the ground, unlike the current streetlights which harshly illuminate the facades causing discomfort for the residents and light pollution. This would have the dual benefit of reducing electrical consumption and light pollution. Ultimately, a comprehensive plan to reduce light pollution across the metropolitan area would be desirable. Toulouse, the cradle of CNES, should be able to see its stars again.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Equip the streetlights in Busca along the Canal du Midi with shape detectors. Shape detection allows for controlling the operating costs of lighting by providing light only when there is confirmed use of the public space. This involves detecting the presence of human movements at night. The streetlights would operate at only 20% of their power, except when they detect a person."
135;2022;"""Green"" Restructuring of Roger Arnaud Square";"Take advantage of the funding from this call for ideas to initiate reflection with TM, and a design office if necessary, on a complete restructuring of Roger Arnaud square, which is partly sacrificed to parking today. Our Association, after detailed surveys of the functioning of this place (behaviors of residents, pedestrian, bicycle, car traffic, and parking), concluded the possibility of restructuring this emblematic site for the ""Pont des Demoiselles"" neighborhood heart. This would lead to:
- Creating a large green square in place of the current parking lot.
- Simplifying the organization of bicycle and car flows by eliminating, in particular, the intersections of different traffics in the funnel located between the square and Saint-Exupéry avenue.
- Facilitating and securing the movements of bicycles and scooters, which are numerous to use this compulsory passage between the northern part of the neighborhood, educational establishments, the Canal du Midi track, and beyond to the city center or the university campus.
- Offering pedestrians a comfortable and pleasant site to cross towards and from Pradal street, which will lead them to the Jean Rieux station of the TAE metro line, and whose narrowest sidewalk sections should be widened by 2028.
- Maintaining a parking offer along the reorganized roads to meet the needs of the businesses and services of the neighborhood heart, managing it through regulations that stimulate good usage rotation.

If the funding associated with the call for ideas allowed it, why not start some of the work or actions related to this restructuring, which seems essential to us in the medium term and would bring back, under the plane trees, greenery, children's games, perhaps an open-air market at the heart of the neighborhood, etc.

Implementation modalities - Technical opinion:
Roger Arnaud square is part of the perimeter of a ""Cœur de quartier"" operation by Toulouse Métropole. It is proposed to strengthen the component dedicated to the greening of Arnaud square, in addition to the ongoing ""Cœur de quartier"" project, which aims to requalify public spaces."
91;2022;Swift and bat nesting boxes + traps for tiger mosquito larvae or adults;"Like other municipalities in the metropolis, it would be useful to consider the town hall's participation in the costs of nest boxes for swifts and bats (a bulk order by the town hall would also help to reduce the unit price) for a collective fight against the tiger mosquito. These nest boxes would be distributed to individuals who would place them at their homes. Similarly, participation in traps for larvae or adult tiger mosquitoes could also be considered. 

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Regarding bats, they are useful against mosquitoes (notably of the Culex genus). Against tiger mosquitoes (of the Aedes genus), which notably bite during the day, bats - which are active at dusk or nocturnal - cannot deploy their full effectiveness. For biodiversity reasons, it is very useful to promote the installation of bats in the territory, but in the context of combating the presence of the tiger mosquito, other solutions should be prioritized. Swifts are part of the daytime avifauna that preys on flying insects. However, their flight paths are too high for tiger mosquitoes, and the installation of nest boxes is excluded because for the nest boxes to be colonized, they must be installed near an existing colony or be part of a playback campaign (audio tape playing the calls of swifts).

Nest boxes for swallows might be more interesting because the flight height of swallows makes them natural predators of flying insects, like the tiger mosquito. In terms of colonization, the same difficulties apply as for swifts. Implementing oviposition traps seems to be the most appropriate idea, however, care must be taken as this measure must be adopted by the Municipal Council to be implemented and, if this is the case, it would be generalized for the entire territory of Toulouse, thus requiring a significant budget.

Cost per nest box: 30 euros.
Cost of oviposition traps: 30 euros for 2. A budget of approximately 60,000 euros is needed to equip the private spaces of Toulouse and 12,000 euros to equip the public spaces."
174;2022;Let's restore color to the green spaces of Chemin de la Fronde;"This idea was submitted via a paper form by Maïté. I regularly pass along Chemin de la Fronde and I notice that the green spaces are frequented by high school students, employees from nearby businesses, and residents of the neighborhood. These spaces are not being showcased well. It would be inexpensive to improve the condition of these areas to make them more pleasant with new plantings and by creating picnic areas. We are fortunate to have green spaces; we might as well enhance them.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The project is coherent and technically feasible. It will beautify the site with new furniture (picnic tables + benches + trash bins) and the planting of some new vegetation so that residents can enjoy it. However, be mindful of potential noise disturbances, especially at night, that such developments might cause. A consultation with the residents living adjacent to this site could be considered."
12;2022;Greening of Place Saint Sernin, Rue Alsace, and the forecourt of the station;"Replace the excessive cobblestones with lawns and trees on Alsace Street, Saint Sernin Square, and Matabiau Station forecourt, where possible, of course.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Regarding Alsace Lorraine Street, an enhancement in terms of greening can be considered: however, the chosen arrangements must receive the favorable opinion of the Architect of French Buildings and meet the requirements/constraints related to high pedestrian traffic and multiple uses of the street. On the other hand, Saint-Sernin Square has undergone a major redevelopment, during which more than 80 trees were planted. A garden was created at the apse of the basilica, and a garden/playground was established in the courtyard of the St-Sernin gymnasium (replacing a parking lot). On Saint-Sernin Square, the tree planting was regulated (UNESCO World Heritage site) but also constrained by the presence of archaeological remains at a very shallow depth (-20cm on the forecourt, -40cm in front of the high school). Therefore, the decision was made to elevate the ground to allow for tree planting. Additional plantings are not feasible. This part of the proposal will not be put to a vote."
126;2022;Canal du Midi bank landscaping;Port St Sauveur, remove the parking spaces and convert them into lawns and green spaces. Implementation details - Technical opinion: It is proposed to redevelop this area by implementing tactical and transitional urban planning measures. If this idea is adopted, it will be possible to improve pedestrian crossings between the building base and the riverbanks, to prohibit vehicle parking, and to create a dedicated pedestrian space for the right bank quay. If greening is not the initial goal envisioned (since it is the spirit of the port and the quay that, according to the Grand Parc Canal study, must prevail), this project proposes: the installation of large communal tables and seating furniture, which could be paired with shade structures to provide shade during the hottest hours. This development will promote new uses that are both peaceful and convivial.
139;2022;Development of the Pech-David observatory site;"With the recent arrival of the Toulouse cable car, the residents of the neighborhood see their living spaces transforming. The green base of Pech David, where the observatory is located and which is so adored by walkers, families, and Toulouse athletes, is altering and gradually changing its face. It is mutating into a parking area that extends further and further, where the car - although we are in an era increasingly concerned about our planet - aspires to become the queen (parking on the grass, on the edge of the cliff, around the observatory, even on hiking trails...). Yet our queen is the Pech David area. We see its flora and fauna changing; the ways of enjoying this space deteriorated. Indeed, for the past two years, it has been an open-air parking lot that modifies the uses and frequentations of this site and our neighborhood. Our wish is then to bring back to the forefront the active, family, and sports dynamics of Pech David. We would like developments aimed at respecting the place for what it represents to our city, as a green lung, but especially for our neighborhood. We then imagine relaxation and exchange areas (on the ground or through eco-responsible furniture). Pétanque or mölkky courts transforming the path dedicated to the cable car works into small game fields. Above all, we would like to restore the green spaces to bring back nature, sacrificed in the name of the automobile and the ease of access for Toulouse residents. They could actually reuse the initial parking areas (parking on the other side of the observatory road, parking at the stadiums after the equestrian center,...), and walk to the observatory site. It is with great respect for our neighborhood, but also for our city that as young Toulouse residents, athletes, and lovers of Pech David, we hope that this project will be retained. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion:
Development of sports and relaxation areas at the Pech-David observatory site. This project would consist of installing several picnic tables shaded by tree plantations around the observatory, not far from the water tower. In addition, outdoor sports facilities (pétanque court, area for mölkky...) as well as seating would be installed. This project would complement the security and accessibility improvements of the observatory site (renovation of pedestrian paths, installation of signage...), already planned by the community."
32;2022;Preserve trees, airy spaces, and soccer/basketball courts around the La Grave dome (planting of fruit trees near the playground);"With global warming, it is absolutely essential to preserve as many trees and open spaces in our neighborhoods as possible, especially around the Dôme de Lagrave where a very large building with 200 housing units is already being constructed next door (Dôme Building - Kaufmann & Broad). The Asso St Cyprien quartier libre wishes to keep the existing green spaces and playgrounds for teenagers (the nearby Raymond 6 park does not allow team sports), in order to BREATHE, and to create communal nourishing and educational gardens. Thank you! We need to move into the 21st century: it will not be the century of concrete!

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Creation of an orchard of more than 2500m2 on the existing green space near the playground, to provide a nourishing area for the residents of the neighborhood. Regarding the basketball court, however, it belongs to the CHU and the community does not have control over this land, so this part of the proposal has not been accepted."
151;2022;Developing Henri Russel Square;"Henri Russel Square is today entirely mineral at ground level, except for the trees that surround it, and is generally neglected by residents who do not frequent it. Its use and design need to be rethought, as suggested by the call for ideas that has been launched. Proposed development for the area includes: - creating a green barrier to isolate it from Crampel Avenue - creating a children's play area themed around Henri Russel's seven caves. Implementation details - Technical opinion: The improvement of Henri Russell Square will be considered as follows: - Ensuring accessibility to the square and its pedestrian crossings; - Adding more greenery; - Installing more seating; - Promoting soft mobility by adding bike racks and relocating the Vélô Toulouse station; - Maintaining parking availability; - Highlighting the Wallace fountain; - Developing a playground area."
52;2022;Planting vegetation to limit summer overheating and neighborhood comfort...;... by planting trees on highly asphalted streets, greening them and/or changing the ground materials. The secondary streets involved will first need to be made one-way to achieve this, to gain space, comfort, and safety for all users. This request also responds to the current city council's ambition to plant 100,000 trees. Location: Fontaine Lestang neighborhood in Toulouse. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Greening of the Fontaine Lestang neighborhood in the most asphalted streets to combat heat islands and reduce summer temperatures. The exact planting areas will be coordinated with the residents, to collectively determine the parking spaces that could be replaced by green spaces.
25;2022;Greening Matabiau Street;"Matabiau Street is one of the main gateways to the hyper-center of Toulouse. With numerous typical buildings and a dynamic neighborhood life, this street remains a heat island and generally lacks nature. Therefore, we propose to green Matabiau Street along the segment between Jeanne D'Arc Square and Roquelaine Square (the section of the street that can be most quickly and easily adapted), in order to create a healthy and sustainable environment. For this purpose, we propose the installation of planters and trees by encroaching on some parking spaces, and the implementation of a policy to encourage the flowering of balconies with hanging planters. Specifically, we propose the installation of between 12 and 20 trees/shrubs on the odd-numbered side of the street (where parking spaces are located), with flower beds in giant planters integrated into the urban environment. These planters would be placed on the roadway (so as not to reduce pedestrian space), between certain parking spaces or in place of some of them. Some delivery areas (which are mostly used for parking) would be reduced. To encourage harmonious balcony flowering, we propose that the city council select a model of planter suitable for Toulouse balconies, and offer the possibility of purchasing them at reduced prices for each resident of the street, with a proposal of robust and flowering plant species to plant (e.g., various colors of pelargonium, heather, ivy...). The goal of this project is to provide shade in a busy wide street, in the same way that was done for the nearby Rue de la Concorde. This project would involve both the municipality and the residents of the street. In a second phase, it could also be considered to green certain facades, particularly those of public buildings such as the Matabiau School. The greening of the urban space would improve air quality, reduce heat islands, and enhance the quality of life for the neighborhood's residents.

Implementation Details - Technical Opinion:
The greening of Roquelaine Square is a project currently under study by the Community. The architect of the French buildings wishes to develop an urban forest incorporating a playground over the entire area of the square. The budget for this type of development is around €500,000 and cannot be included in this call for projects.

Regarding Matabiau Street, in order not to constrain a possible future street development project, a system of planters can be considered on the parking spaces. This type of development will require road support as these elements could constitute obstacles on the roadway and present a danger to cyclists."
27;2022;Greening and conviviality of the Saint-Aubin neighborhood;"To combat urban heat islands and also to make the neighborhood more pleasant, a simple solution is to green the streets and open spaces by removing asphalt whenever possible. In the neighborhood, many spaces are suitable for this. Numerous plant species (trees, shrubs, and flowers) are adapted to our very dry climates in summer. See, for example, the guides published by CEREMA, a national body that Toulouse Métropole has also consulted on the subject: https://www.cerema.fr/fr/actualites/accompagnement-toulouse-metropole-identifier-potentiel Moreover, removing asphalt from the ground is far preferable to simply placing planters because it contributes to the de-impermeabilization of the soil. Watering these full-soil areas could be done by partially diverting rainwater. This greening must be accompanied by the installation of street furniture (benches, chairs, playgrounds for children) allowing residents to reclaim their neighborhood. For example, we propose:
- Rue Riquet: de-asphalt parking spaces (for example, alternate 2-3 green spaces with 4-5 parking spaces). The freed space will be planted with trees, shrubs, or floral beds depending on the constraints related to underground networks. Such an arrangement could also be done on Rue Gabriel Péri.
- Rue Riquet / on Place Saint-Aubin where the sidewalks are wide: replace the poles with an 80 cm wide green strip.
- Place Bachelier: this square is large and entirely mineral. There is enough space to install trees but also large full-soil flower beds. It would also be possible to install benches, for example, circular benches around the newly planted trees. This square could become a cool island.
- Around Saint-Aubin church: install benches under the shade of trees.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
On Place Saint-Aubin, the presence of the market strongly constrains any installation in these spaces. Additional greening seems complex given the uses of this square.
Moreover, the presence of an underground parking in front of the church allows little or no full-soil planting.
However, a study for the installation of planters to green the pergolas at the parking entrances is underway.
Regarding Rue Riquet, the greening project should be discussed in September with local residents and shopkeepers.
For Place Bachelier, it is possible to plant trees, up to 3 in number."
125;2022;Plant trees between the ring road and the greenway of the Hers;The Hers greenway, which runs alongside the ring road, could be much more pleasant for walking and sports if there were more trees between the ring road and it. By adding trees, including some evergreens, this green area would be better shielded from the traffic of the ring road. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Planting trees in alignment along the greenway, from Avenue Jean Chaubet to Avenue de Castres is feasible. The number of trees that can be planted will depend on the presence of networks in this geographical area of Toulouse (public lighting network and strategic network for wastewater and stormwater). Given the current public contracts, it is possible, within the allocated budget, to plant a hundred trees.
142;2022;Greenway to Pech David;"Olive Tree Lane serves the green area of Pech David. This rural road is pleasant but unfortunately subject to illegal dumping and quad biking. It is not a crucial access route since the houses are only at the bottom and accessible via Salade Ponsan Road. It could be transformed into a greenway starting/ending at the height restriction barriers with a ban on motor vehicles. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Development of a pedestrian path on Olive Tree Lane, enhancing access to the natural and privileged setting of the green area of Pech-David by favoring soft modes of transport. If the project wins, it would allow for the establishment of a ""tactical"" or ""temporary"" pathway, before its permanent implementation."
141;2022;Tiger mosquito traps;Tiger mosquitoes are ruining our lives by preventing us from enjoying gardens during the beautiful days. However, there are effective and environmentally safe mosquito traps available. For these to be effective, they need to be used on a large scale, across an entire neighborhood, for example. This has been successfully implemented in cities in the southeast. I therefore propose setting up this type of trap in the neighborhood. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Installation of 40 mosquito breeding traps in the Rangueil, Pech-David, Sauzelong, Pouvourville neighborhoods around public facilities (schools, nurseries, public parks, etc.).
162;2022;Long live solar energy on the rooftops of public buildings!;"Make way for renewable energies! I propose the installation of solar panels on all available surfaces of public buildings (schools, gymnasiums, neighborhood town halls) to power these buildings, public lighting, and possibly more. Long-term profitability guaranteed. This is what we call sustainable development!

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The solarization of public buildings is one of the primary missions of Toulouse Métropole and the AOEN service of the Energy and Environment Directorate, in order to meet the objectives of the Master Energy Plan. The Littré school group, located in district 6.1, already has a photovoltaic installation, and the Fleurance school group is currently under study.

Three sites potentially favorable for energy production have been identified in the district:
- the neighborhood town hall and its parking lot, with a production of 84 kWp for an investment of about €135,000 excluding tax
- St Martin du Touch church, with a production of 19 kWp for an investment of about €30,000 excluding tax
- St Martin du Touch gymnasium, for an investment of about €175,000 excluding tax

A structural study of the roofs must be carried out, as well as, on a case-by-case basis, reinforcement to support the solar panels."
172;2022;Improvement of cycle paths;The existing bike paths are sometimes difficult to use (dedicated path then transition to a high, narrow sidewalk to be shared with pedestrians, maintenance of hedges along the paths and/or sidewalks, ground markings not always present...). Review the markings and signage for greater safety for both cyclists and motorists. Implementation details - Technical opinion: A diagnosis of the problems encountered in this neighborhood can be conducted with the residents to precisely identify the interventions needed and establish an action plan.
128;2022;Installation of Urban Beehives;Create urban beehives managed by neighborhood volunteers who have received prior training. The harvested honey will be tasted at neighborhood events or others. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Installation of four beehives in the Pont des Demoiselles – Ormeau – Montaudran - Malepère neighborhood for an associative and local honey production. The community will commit to providing the beehives as well as the necessary equipment for their operation by neighborhood residents, provided that the volunteer residents are capable of maintaining them and that the beehives are registered with the Departmental Directorate of Veterinary Services (DDSV).
195;2022;Deploy preventive equipment to mosquito-proof the neighborhood;"The proliferation of mosquitoes is a problem regularly raised by the residents of the neighborhood, especially as the phenomenon seems to intensify year after year. Awareness and prevention efforts among the population are necessary but do not seem sufficient, nor do individual initiatives by some residents. The inhabitants of Lafourguette wish for the installation of equipment in the public sectors of the neighborhood: pheromone mosquito terminals, shelters for bats, or swallow nest boxes (see point H above). We particularly propose that the initiative carried out by the Toulouse City Hall in various municipal nurseries and schools in Toulouse be deployed within the perimeter of our neighborhood.

Implementation modalities - Technical opinion:
The Toulouse City Hall already uses mosquito terminals, especially in early childhood areas. Their operating principle is to mimic human presence and capture at the biting stage. In the presence of the public, the terminal will trap mosquitoes, but other individuals will continue to bite.

The system could be complemented by the installation of 40 breeding traps in the neighborhood to combat tiger mosquitoes. The breeding traps stop the proliferation (laying) and capture tiger mosquitoes. Specific to this species, this solution intervenes at a key and unavoidable stage of the tiger mosquito's life cycle; Bat nest boxes are less relevant because bats are active at dusk or even nocturnal, and tiger mosquitoes particularly bite during the day (morning and early evening before nightfall), thus they are not the most appropriate predators to combat these mosquitoes."
29;2022;Terrifying bike lane on Matabiau Boulevard;"Most cyclists are afraid to use it: it is sometimes very narrow (especially near the Matabiau bridge), sometimes cluttered with parked vehicles (especially before the Raisin footbridge), never protected from vehicles that too often drive beyond 50 km/h. Thus, bicycles go onto the pedestrian sidewalk along the canal, and pedestrians are not happy, or onto the sidewalk on the building side, and the pedestrians... Could we recalibrate the width, and, above all, install ""balisettes"" (like on av. Honoré Serres nearby) to separate motor vehicles from cyclists, which should alleviate their fear of being crushed?

Implementation modalities - Technical opinion:
Boulevard Matabiau has two lanes of traffic and a 1.2-meter-wide cycle lane, which narrows down to 1 meter on certain sections. Working on the neglected shoulders along the canal and recalibrating the lanes could allow for a more comfortable 1.75-meter-wide cycle lane, without reducing the number of lanes dedicated to motorists. Moreover, protection of this lane could be considered, either by installing balisettes or by creating a solid island. The section studied as part of the call for ideas is located between the Matabiau Bridge and the Raisin footbridge (but such an arrangement could be extended)."
193;2022;Eisenhower: Trees for Bike Paths;"I commute by bike between home and work and suggest planting trees along the avenue to provide shade on the bike paths. Especially along Eisenhower Avenue, which is long, very hot in the summer with traffic, and especially with zero coverage throughout. Also, this will add some aesthetics to the place and undoubtedly reduce the pollution levels on this artery.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The request made corresponds to the community's objectives to green and plant Eisenhower Avenue, particularly to provide shade to spaces dedicated to soft modes of transport.

These plantings can be integrated in the medium term into the Eisenhower Avenue requalification project planned by the Métropole, with studies starting in 2023 on the section between Firmin PONS roundabout and the Eisenhower / Seysses intersection, with construction starting before the end of the current term and full delivery during the following term.

Also, as such, it is not feasible to plant along the avenue without completing the studies related to this complete requalification project.

However, the planting project planned under the St SIMON EISENHOWER Urban Partnership Project, implemented from the end of 2022 or 2023, will respond to the proposal made for the greenway section along the south side of Eisenhower Avenue between Basso Cambo path and Lestang path.

The planned plantings along the greenway (about 80 trees) will be carried out between the greenway and the raw water ditch in this section."
173;2022;Implementation of a health trail and facilities at Mounède Park;Creation of a health trail materialized in or around Parc de la Mounède. Accessible to all, with a picnic area and/or children's playground. Implementation details - Technical opinion: A running/walking trail, whose route is identified on Toulouse.fr (Route 6 BASSO CAMBO), exists nearby. This trail passes close to Parc de la Mounède. In response to this idea, Parc de la Mounède could initially be equipped with a fitness station and signage to direct athletes to the walking trail.
41;2022;Greening Croix de Pierre (greening of Avenue de Muret);Green the tramway circulation areas when it operates in dedicated spaces and add cultivated areas with flowers at Place Croix de Pierre. Allow the trees on Avenue de Muret to grow without severe pruning. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Greening of Avenue de Muret to reduce concrete surfaces along this route. Regarding the section from Fer à Cheval to Place Croix-de-Pierre, it involves greening around the bases of trees. For the section from Croix-de-Pierre to the roundabout of September 21, the greening would be achieved by replacing some parking spaces. In front of Maurice Bécane elementary school, this would notably help secure the waiting area for children and parents. As for the tramway, this option was not selected because the land belongs to Tisseo and not to the community. The proposal for cultivated and flowered spaces has not been studied within the participatory budget framework but will be considered in the redevelopment project of Place Croix-de-Pierre. Finally, the curtain pruning on Avenue de Muret is carried out to ensure the safe passage of the tramway.
40;2022;Replace parking spaces with trees;Many streets in Toulouse are very mineral, devoid of any vegetation, thus creating heat islands and are often unsightly. Meanwhile, most of the city's streets serve as parking lots for vehicles that seldom move, which constitutes a huge waste of space, precious in an urban environment. More generally, 60% of the road surface (sidewalks and roads) is dedicated to automobiles and other motor vehicles, which themselves contribute to warming. It would be wise to identify the most mineral streets, and replace a certain proportion of parking spaces with trees that will provide shade and coolness, and make these streets more beautiful. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Greening of Réclusane and Adolphe Coll streets by replacing some parking spaces with vegetation, similar to what has been done on rue de la Chaine in Toulouse. The exact locations will be defined in consultation with the residents.
137;2022;Installation of a fitness trail in the Montaudran district near the Halle de la Machine.;"Want to stay fit or get back into sports? That's all we're missing in our neighborhood 😊 To stay in shape, it's not necessarily necessary to spend money! I propose to the mayor to install a fitness trail in this neighborhood that is starting to develop and move :D Engaging in physical and sports activities for free, freely, simply, and according to your level; the fitness trail is a self-service access that we can go to whenever we have a little slot in our daily life and routine, allowing us to exercise outdoors without lightening our wallets. Implementation details - Technical opinion: In addition to the greening of the Piste des Géants, it is proposed to set up areas for games, relaxation, and sports. If the idea wins the vote, the choice of these facilities will be subject to consultation between the residents of the Montaudran neighborhood and the community services."
203;2022;Install bike racks in front of all businesses and green spaces.;"Today, not only is it difficult to cycle in the neighborhoods of Toulouse (due to poor road conditions and dangerous lanes), but it is also often hard to lock one's bike in front of a shop (for example, on route d'Agde or avenue Jean Chaubet) or in front of a green space (Argoulets, the micro-forest of the Giants above the COSEC of Rangueil). The more bike racks there are, the more bicycles there will be, and thus, fewer cars. Implementation details - Technical opinion: This idea is feasible; it is possible to add racks at locations to be determined in the neighborhood."
68;2022;A mural in the heart of the Bourrassol neighborhood that enhances nature in a significant living space for the residents.;"The neighborhood in which I live is primarily characterized by its quality of life, whether through its residents, environment, nature, or services. Place des Micocouliers is a central spot where one finds a community solidarity center, a daycare, a community garden, and where the neighborhood population gathers in a friendly atmosphere. To beautify this site and give it a cultural identity, my idea is to have an artistic mural created that enhances nature on a wall overlooking the square and thus visible to all passersby. The co-owners of Résidence Esprit Garonne agree to dedicate this wall to the artwork. The theme of this mural should highlight the natural and animal elements in harmony with the green and friendly character of Place des Micocouliers and, more broadly, the entire neighborhood. Moreover, this project will raise awareness about Street Art (workshops, observation, artistic encounters). To this end, I will support the creation of the mural with a photo report that will be available to everyone via the website of the Comité de Quartier Fontaines Garonne.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Creation of a mural in the heart of the Bourrassol neighborhood, facing the green space on Antonio Vivaldi Street, to beautify the site and raise awareness among residents about Street Art. The patterns and theme can be discussed with the neighborhood residents."
11;2022;Bike inflation stations on the busiest routes;"To encourage cycling and help cyclists maintain the correct tire pressure on their journeys (work, shopping, sports outings, or leisure), public inflation stations could be installed at various locations in the city of Toulouse. Public inflation stations are already installed in several cities in France, for example, Bordeaux or Besançon, but also abroad in Geneva (Switzerland), Uppsala (Sweden). Having experienced it myself, I believe it is a major advancement in welcoming cycling to the center of urban mobility. It is often once on a bike that one realizes being under-inflated, whereas a bicycle tire at the right pressure allows to:
- reduce the energy consumed by the battery of electric bikes
- make a bike ride less tiring and more enjoyable
- limit the number of punctures
On average, it is necessary to inflate tires every 2 to 4 weeks to keep them at the ideal pressure specified by the manufacturer. Busy routes can be targeted for the installation of such stations like:
- The Canal du Midi (at the level of CEMES the track widens enough to accommodate such a station)
- The bike path along the Garonne at the level of the roundabout of Catalonia
- Les Ponts Jumeaux - etc.
and in the city center:
- Allées Jules Guesde
- Place du metro Esquirol
- Place du metro Saint Cyprien
- Around the Basilica of Saint Sernin - etc.
Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: 2 stations of this type are already in service at Port St Sauveur (at the Capitainerie) and in the Bagatelle district. In the hyper-center, the installation of this type of equipment will have to receive the favorable opinion of the Architecte des Bâtiments de France (locations to be determined). The installation of 3 stations is proposed."
16;2022;Continue along the Brienne alley bike path until you reach Paul-Séjourné Avenue.;"Continue the bike path along Allée de Brienne up to Avenue Paul Séjourné.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Currently, the Allées de Brienne have a cycling link between the Amidonniers school and the underpass of Avenue Séjourné (cycling lane on the road and service roads). However, from the underpass onwards, there are no facilities, particularly for reaching Avenue Paul Séjourné, which is identified as a key axis of the Express Bike Network (REV).

Therefore, it is feasible to create a bike path on this section of Allée de Brienne: this project requires the removal of existing parking and the felling of trees planted between the underpass and the rise to Avenue Séjourné."
119;2022;Neighborhood Greening;"In the Bonhoure neighborhood, at the corner of Jean Chaubet Avenue and Monié Street, replace the asphalted triangle currently used as an illegal dump with a green space. For a few tens of thousands of euros, the soil can be easily decontaminated and grass and trees planted. Besides the aesthetic appeal, this would help deter further dumping of trash and also allow the trees to absorb the pollution, which is very prevalent at this part of the avenue.

Implementation details:
After review by the competent technical services, it is possible to green this space. It should be noted that the presence of networks will not allow for the planting of very large trees, but it is possible to lay grass and plant shrubs. The area must also be equipped with anti-parking bollards."
106;2022;Bike lane and one-way street on rue de Périole;"Creation of a bicycle lane on Rue de Périole to secure travel to the Marengo and Bonnefoy schools in particular. The street is particularly busy and dangerous due to excessive speeding by motorists. Since the street does not currently allow for the creation of a bicycle lane, why not create a one-way system from the Périole roundabout/Cheminots street to Lavaur Avenue? This would also allow for the widening of sidewalks, which are too narrow on this section.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The works on Faubourg Bonnefoy as part of the construction of the 3rd metro line do not allow for Rue de Périole to be made one-way. Consequently, it is not feasible to create a bicycle lane on this axis before 2028. However, this axis is heavily used by cyclists and it is appropriate to secure it. Consequently, a tactical urbanism project is considered. It is possible to create a Shared Central Lane (Chaussée à Voie Centrale Banalisée, CVCB) while waiting for the street to be made one-way and for permanent development."
192;2022;Greening of the Thibaud Business Area;"The objective is to promote the reduction of the ambient temperature in the Thibaud area, one of the hottest zones in Toulouse.
- Planting trees along the entire artisanal and commercial zone of Thibaud and Larrieu to lower the ambient temperature (each business or company receives a tree and must provide it with appropriate care), in partnership with ARBRES ET PAYSAGES D'AUTAN, an association of which the Toulouse city council is a member,
- Planting different species of trees to limit infestations linked to a single tree population,
- Promoting the return of bird species to our city,
- Encouraging the pollination of fruit trees soon to be planted nearby on the Candie estate,
- Limiting pollution related to vehicles (noise, smells, particles).

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The planting in the Thibaud activity zone is partially feasible because the land is highly constrained (vehicle entry and exit, insufficient sidewalks, private land). However, the few scattered trees that could be planted in certain sectors of the public space would still provide a modest landscape contribution."
169;2022;Stop the mosquitoes! Let's switch to traps!;"Hello everyone, since the city of Toulouse is no longer mosquito-spraying, my idea would be to invest in mosquito traps as other cities are already doing! By installing connected mosquito traps, the traps calculate the number of captures, in order to study the locations most attacked by mosquitoes. Toulouse would maintain its ""pesticide-free"" label and could manage the proliferation of mosquitoes. And we could finally enjoy terraces and outdoor areas without being attacked! Thank you all.

Neighborhood: Lardenne

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The Toulouse City Hall uses anti-mosquito terminals near enclosed spaces such as early childhood facilities (effective from 15 to 60m). Their operating principle is to mimic human presence and capture at the biting stage.

On the neighborhood scale, the system could be supplemented by installing 40 breeding traps in the neighborhood to combat tiger mosquitoes. The breeding traps stop the proliferation (breeding) and capture tiger mosquitoes. Specific to this species, this solution intervenes at a key and essential stage of the tiger mosquito's life cycle."
58;2022;A bike path for better continuity on Rue Henri Desbals;"Today, there is a gap in the cycle path on Henri Desbals Street between Mermoz and Déodat de Séverac Boulevard. Creating a secure cycling continuity over these 900 meters would complete this route, which has the potential to become a fast and safe way to reach the city center from the neighborhoods, as well as Jean Jaurès University from the city center. This section would serve the Fontaine Lestang metro station and the Etiennes Billières kindergarten. Moreover, promoting active modes of transport on this axis is also an opportunity to calm car traffic for better safety and less pollution. I propose making Henri Desbals Street one-way from Mermoz Square to Déodat de Séverac Boulevard. With one of the two lanes freed up, it then becomes possible to create a two-way cycle path of adequate width (about 3m). This one-way configuration does not block the flow of motorized vehicles, which could take a detour either via Vestrepain Street or Gamelin Street. I propose to first implement this arrangement as a temporary yellow ""coronapiste"" so as not to block future improvement possibilities in case of permanence. This choice would also reduce costs and provide a cheaper track!

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Experiment with making Henri Desbals Street one-way between Fontaine Lestang and Déodat de Séverac to create a two-way cycle path to facilitate and secure the movement of cyclists. Making the rest of the street one-way requires a more comprehensive traffic study at the neighborhood level to assess its impacts. This section has therefore been excluded in this call for ideas but will be studied later."
26;2022;Strolling down Raymond IV Street;Observation: Rue Raymond IV, with its north-south orientation, becomes a heat sink that divides the neighborhood from June to October. Proposal: Following the model of the two parallel streets that surround it, Rue Bayard and Rue de la Concorde: green the street by planting trees on each side. Feasibility: With sidewalks wider than those on Rue de la Concorde, such planting is entirely possible without impacting parking. Benefits: - create a cooler zone - address the pollution caused by the Jeanne d'Arc bus station by absorbing excess CO2 - Establish a new green link between the boulevards and the Canal du Midi - Meet Toulouse's goal of 100,000 trees Implementation details - Technical opinion: The possibility of neutralizing some parking spaces in favor of green spaces can be considered. Subject to precise studies of the location of networks to determine the type of vegetation that can be planted in these areas. Rue Raymond IV has numerous parking spaces located on both sides of the street. This street is completely mineralized and exposed to the sun. The presence of networks has been noted under sidewalks, and the gas network is present under the parking on the even-numbered side. The creation of green islands with tree planting is therefore possible on the odd-numbered side of the street.
30;2022;Soothing of Boulevard Riquet;"Boulevard Riquet currently consists of sections with either 2 or 3 car traffic lanes and 1 or 2 car parking lanes. For example, the section between Rue Péri and Allées Jean-Jaurès has 3 traffic lanes + 2 parking lanes for cars: this leaves little space for pedestrians on a narrow sidewalk, or for bicycles, on the Canal side. View of the 5 lanes dedicated to cars at 48 Boulevard Riquet: http://www.bvsa.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-09-17-boulevard-riquet-01.jpg While waiting for a possible renovation project of the Canal du Midi banks (?), to calm Boulevard Riquet, we propose to: replace a traffic lane with a bus lane (which would improve transit times) remove a parking lane install a bicycle lane / cycle path on the boulevard. The arrangement of the bicycle lane on the Boulevard could be done in ""tactical urbanism"" temporarily and experimentally. This bicycle lane on the boulevard will allow the Canal banks to be left to pedestrians and absorb the ever-growing flow of cyclists. We propose to deploy this arrangement from the Saint-Aubin footbridge (or even before from the Genes Lougnon barracks) to Allées Jean-Jaurès. Calming and reducing traffic on Boulevard Riquet would have a strong impact on air quality by reducing car pollution. This road is indeed particularly polluted as shown by the analyses of ATMO Occitanie. Example of car pollution mapping (ATMO Occitanie data 2016): http://www.bvsa.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/32021-09-17-boulevard-riquet-02-pollution-atmo.jpg It is also worth considering a temporal alternation of uses. Parking spaces are little used during the day because they are paid, while they are more used at night when they are free. The created bus lane could be used during the day, then transform into a parking lane at night, similar to the alternation of parking and market stalls on Boulevard de Strasbourg. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: In view of the ""My Ideas for My Neighborhood"" rules and the maximum amount allocated to each proposed idea, only one type of arrangement is feasible: the establishment of a bus corridor open to bicycles, maintaining two lanes of traffic. This arrangement, which can be implemented in the short term, however, only addresses one direction of traffic for bicycles."
170;2022;Secure the crossing of the Cépière bridge for cyclists;As part of the development of bus+bike lanes from Saint Simon des Arènes to la Cépière, create a secure bike lane to cross the bridge and reach the roundabout at la Cépière, then the Polyvalent Rive Gauche high school. Implementation details - technical opinion: This request will be integrated into the development project of Avenue de Bazerque, planned from St Sauveur roundabout to la Cépière roundabout, and will be extended to include crossing the ring road.
56;2022;An orchard for the children of the asphalt (planting of fruit trees in the neighborhood);"ALIMECO is a non-profit organization founded in 2020 following the health crisis to address the food emergency of families. It serves all residents of the BAFAPATABOR neighborhoods (Bagatelle, Faourette, Papus, Tabar, and Bordelongue). ALIMECO consists of 40 volunteers, one part-time employee, and aims to develop food autonomy in these areas. In the spirit of the municipal plan ""100,000 trees in Toulouse by 2030,"" we propose the idea of a sustainable and constructive project: to plant 300 fruit trees in BaFaPaTaBor, each symbolically bearing the first name of a child or youth in these neighborhoods where 10,000 residents are between 0 and 17 years old. The objectives are multiple: 1) Maintain and enrich biodiversity in a highly urbanized area: the tree species to be planted will be fully adapted to the Toulouse biotope; 2) Involve residents in caring for living beings, in an ecologically virtuous manner, in line with the ""Toulouse Tree Charter""; 3) Promote access to quality food, from a healthy and seasonal source (ALIMECO's main purpose): harvesting, processing, preservation, via the Bagatelle Community Center, for example; 4) Create a lasting sponsorship ""One tree, one youth, one name"" by recreating the link between the living and these neighborhoods, which economic and social precariousness often keeps distant from these essential themes. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: Planting a hundred fruit trees spread over two green spaces to create an orchard for the neighborhood residents. More in-depth analyses will be conducted before planting to check soil pollution."
155;2022;Fighting against cigarette butt pollution;"In 2017, the Surfrider association identified cigarette butts as the main plastic waste found in the environment, whether on beaches, sea beds, rivers, or lakes. Cigarette butts are non-biodegradable plastic waste, most often made of cellulose acetate. However, they are photodegradable; thus, the raw material eventually dissolves in water or soil. According to the INEPS (National Institute of Education and Prevention for Health), substances found in cigarette butts include hydrocyanic acid, naphthalene, nicotine, ammonia, cadmium, arsenic, mercury, and even lead among many toxic substances. It is worth noting that nicotine has been used as an insecticide since the 15th century! Even today, it is used as a pesticide in the United States, Canada, and Europe under strict regulations due to its toxicity to aquatic biodiversity (indeed, the molecule is very soluble in water). According to a study conducted by San Diego State University in 2011 on marine and freshwater fish, a single cigarette butt can decimate half of this fish population. Aquatic microorganisms are also affected: some are unable to reproduce, and others are completely paralyzed after prolonged exposure. Moreover, marine animals can ingest cigarette butts, which can lead to their death or undernutrition by causing a false sense of satiety (since the animals do not necessarily regurgitate this element). These ecotoxicological tests lead to attributing to cigarette butts the ""HP 14 ecotoxic hazard property,"" meaning waste that presents or may present immediate or delayed risks to one or more components of the environment. In Toulouse, many cigarette butts are thrown on the ground each year (to give an idea, in the Bordeaux metropolitan area they are estimated at 200 million). However, wastewater is directed to the metropolitan purification stations, while stormwater is directed towards the natural environment such as the Garonne. This means that cigarette butts end up directly in it, releasing their chemical components into the water within an hour, thus polluting it with 2500 harmful substances. To combat this problem, we could: 1/ educate and raise awareness among the general public, particularly by implementing a permanent communication campaign aimed at informing residents about the fate of stormwater and the impact on the natural environment of waste thrown into the sanitation networks, similar to what was done in Bordeaux 2/ equip sewer openings with waste collectors: the principle would consist of installing a removable grilled bin system that would allow the retention and then collection of waste trapped by this filter, thus preventing their fall into the sewer and their transport to the Garonne 3/ establish a partnership, develop a comprehensive and innovative solution for awareness, collection, and recycling of cigarette butts. This could be in the form of an experiment in targeted areas initially (heavy smoking areas such as airports, stations, cinemas, educational institutions like high schools and universities, clusters of bars, etc.) which could then be generalized if the experiment is conclusive. We could start by addressing the axis between Place Lafourcade and Saint Agne Station via Metro Saint Michel. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: To combat pollution from cigarette butt disposal into river waters, the following operation can be carried out: The installation of filtering nets on the stormwater outlets of the Garonne, allowing the recovery of polluting debris upstream. Furthermore, the request is part of the overall approach to combating cigarette butt disposal as part of the urban cleanliness policy of Toulouse Métropole. Actions against cigarette butt disposal will be strengthened between 2023 and 2026 with the implementation of the Extended Producer Responsibility of tobacco."
6;2022;Planting edible trees and plants;"Significantly increase the proportion of edible fruit trees and bushes, whether in parks, on streets (such as Rue de Metz), in squares, or in schools. What could be more delightful than being able to enjoy and pick fruits directly when they are ripe! Apples, pears, figs, raspberries, blackcurrants, cherries; a large number of varieties can grow in Toulouse. Let's teach our children where and how fruits are made! And why not have small vegetable patches in the city's little squares that residents and passersby could maintain, possibly with the guidance of associations explaining how to grow things and what to do when... In short, -much- more nature in the city!

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The presence of fruit-bearing species is not desirable in public spaces, particularly because of the natural material pavements. Regarding Rue de Metz, it is already planned to further green this street as part of its upcoming redevelopment under the Toulouse Centre Project.

However, such plantings are possible in public gardens: it is therefore proposed to plant fruit trees and small fruits in the Jardin d'Embarthe.

It is possible to plant 3 fruit trees and about fifteen small fruit bushes at this location."
84;2022;Shared Compost 'lalala'land;"Why send my waste to be incinerated (like my grandpa) at Mirail along with all the waste from the cities of Toulouse, Blagnac, Cugnaux, and Villeneuve-Tolosane when a large part could be avoided by developing shared composting areas? No solution is currently offered in my neighborhood although I eat my 7 fruits and vegetables a day. And I would like to one day be able to drive on biogas! And what's better than homemade compost to grow my tomatoes in the future shared garden of lalala'lande?

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The shared gardens project in Lalande cannot be realized due to a lack of land. It is possible to consider setting up composters in the Parc de la Violette. This idea allows for the valorization of organic waste produced by households, but it is necessary that a group of at least 30 households be formed to ensure its maintenance and management thereafter."
86;2022;Twin Bridges Green Zone: sports facilities;"The green zone of Ponts-Jumeaux, between Rue des Sports and the ring road, is an interesting space, very large, somewhat wild, poorly developed. The City Hall could upgrade the children's play area, add a picnic space, and also possibly redevelop the large sand football fields into synthetic fields, perhaps reducing their size to make two fields, one for football and one for rugby.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Converting the sand field into 2 synthetic fields is possible but would exceed the allocated budget. To stay within a budget of less than 200,000 euros per idea, it is proposed to install only one synthetic field (out of the 2 proposed, either football or rugby) to be defined later."
76;2022;Greening the Square of the Red Virgin;"Good evening, The Square de la Vierge Rouge is a small empty space in the middle of the roads. Would it be possible to green it? Less pollution! And it beautifies the city. A nice little green space, to beautify vehicles, concrete, and tar. Thank you. Regards,

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The Square de la Vierge Rouge is a place that can be de-impermeabilized and greened. It is possible to create a landscaping arrangement with plants suitable for dry environments adapted to this site. Numerous networks are present under this square and limit the plant palette to low-growing plants. Geolocation of the networks will be necessary to design the project and validate the type of plants to be installed (perennials and shrubs, and depending on the results: a tree or shrub of more or less large size)."
150;2022;Brushstroke on the neighborhood's concrete;The project involves beautifying the raw concrete walls of the neighborhood with street artists' works: Trémie Saint Agne, Pont de la voie ferrée Avenue Crampel, retaining walls of the Pont du Stadium. The idea is to install works that raise awareness about ecology (A-MO, Bordalo, Louis Masai Michel, ...). On a city scale, one could imagine the city of Toulouse proposing a bike discovery tour of Toulouse from the perspective of street art. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: Creation of a mural on a large wall in one of the following neighborhoods: Saint-Agne, Saint-Michel, Le Busca, or Île du Ramier. One or two potential sites must be identified by the City Hall. The subject, as well as the location and scale of the work, will be more precisely defined by a committee composed of municipal elected officials and the artist(s) selected by the community for the realization.
43;2022;Two-way cycle path on Route d'Espagne;A small section of the road to Spain (in front of Gounon castle) is used in both directions by cyclists who must pass on the sidewalk before joining the service road. It is possible to install a bike path on the lawn behind the Barrière de Muret bus stop to prevent inconvenience to other users. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Creation of a bidirectional bicycle path behind the bus stop and two crossings on the road to Spain so that cyclists can join the existing cycling facilities, especially those coming from Barbusse street.
36;2022;Facilitate the crossing of Charles de Fitte alleys;"Crossing Charles de Fitte avenues at the level of Marthe Varsi street is complicated for cyclists traveling from Jardin Raymond VI to Place du Ravelin. Indeed, the green light for pedestrians and cyclists is simultaneous with the green light for cars coming from Varsi street, placing cyclists on the left side of the street when they need to be on the right side towards Place du Ravelin. Some cars turning left towards Pont des Catalans yield to cyclists, while others do not. Moving the pedestrian and cyclist crossing to the other side of the intersection, roughly opposite the Emmaus shop, would be more rational, as cars coming from Varsi street would be obliged to yield to pedestrians and cyclists. Additionally, the street signs on Marthe Varsi street could be changed to indicate ""municipal councilor"" instead of ""municipal councilor.""

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
This project aims to facilitate the crossing for pedestrians and cyclists from Jardin Raymond VI to Place du Ravelin by shifting the pedestrian crossing and relocating the traffic lights for pedestrians. To implement this arrangement, the Toulouse bike station will be moved a few meters."
134;2022;Creation of a bicycle lane on Avenue de la Marcaissonne;"On the right side of Avenue de la Marcaissonne from Route de Revel to the roundabout leading to Avenue de Gameville. This is to allow for cycling access to Marcaissonne Park and to create continuity with the existing bike path in front of the ""Jardins de la Garonne"" on Avenue de Gameville. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Creation of a bike path that allows access to Marcaissonne Park by bicycle and creates continuity with the existing bike path in front of the ""Jardins de la Garonne"" located on Avenue de Gameville. This bike path would thus be positioned on the right side of Avenue de la Marcaissonne from Route de Revel up to number 7 on Avenue de la Marcaissonne."
111;2022;Trees in the schoolyard of Soupetard;"I propose planting several trees in the courtyards of Soupetard elementary school to eventually provide protection against the heat for students during recess and CLAE time. The courtyard surfaces should allow for rainwater infiltration into the soil, and a composter for the leaves could complement this operation. The municipality could offer support for the implementation of an educational project on urban trees alongside this planting to raise students' awareness of global warming.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
This idea is feasible; technical studies for geo-detection of networks will be necessary to find the locations for the future trees. Regarding the composter project, it is possible provided that the educational team leads the project."
87;2022;Military Battle at the 7 Deniers in 1814 (creation of a soldier statue);"The Sept-Deniers were the site of military operations in 1814 during the Battle of Toulouse. Indeed, the main battles took place on the plains of Hers and at Jolimont. Each year, the commemoration is held at the Jolimont Column. Nevertheless, it should not be forgotten that battles also occurred at Ponts Jumeaux, l’Embouchure, and Sept-Deniers. This is why I propose that a monument be erected in memory of these battles for the defense of Toulouse and, why not, a life-size statue symbolizing a soldier of the Grande Armée.

Implementation modalities - Technical opinion:
Two possible options: commissioning a specific artist or issuing a call for projects (with the drafting of specifications that include aesthetic and financial expectations). The call for projects procedure will require the establishment of a selection jury. Note, feasible idea but subject to conditions: a location in the Sept-Deniers district near the post office is conceivable, the cost of realization is estimated between 50,000 and 60,000 €. The General Directorate of Culture of the City Hall wishes to control the placement of works in public spaces, and the establishment of a centralized procedure is underway with the creation of a specific commission judging according to precise criteria the appropriateness of installing a work in public space. Therefore, any proposal must be submitted to this commission, which could refuse (with reasoned arguments) the project for these reasons."
49;2022;Correct the discontinuities between the bike lanes on Bd Déodat de Séverac, the Croix de Pierre tram stop, and the bridge.;"The bike paths at Croix de Pierre deserve to be redeveloped. There is a discontinuity between the bike path on Boulevard Déodat de Severac and the two bike paths (at the Pierre Bourthoumieux roundabout) leading to the Croix de Pierre bridge. On the bike path, there is notably a Velib station, a tree, and a solid fixture to prevent parking. Tisseo travelers exiting the tram to go to the Carrefour City also cross the bike path. More and more people are cycling, and these discontinuities and mobility intersections between tram, pedestrian, and bike are accident-prone.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Improvement of the cycling continuity between Boulevard Déodat de Severac and the Pierre Bourthoumieux roundabout by transforming the bidirectional path into a unidirectional path heading towards Place Croix-de-Pierre, with a return via the service road, through the addition of bike logos and green patches. Also, the traffic light intersection could be modified to facilitate cyclist traffic."
149;2022;A garden in motion along the railway and the rectorate;"To increase the knowledge of city dwellers about the functioning of urban ecosystems, plants, insects... could we invest in new plantings in the green strip along the rectorate and the SNCF railway? The new plantings would consist of:
- sown annual/biennial plants (cornflower, knapweed, vetches, lotus, viper's bugloss, hypericum, knautia, chicory, groundsel),
- planted shrubs: elderberry, strawberry tree, fig tree, honeysuckles...
- planted, sown, propagated trees...
- artistic installations: seed traps, braided branches, decomposing logs.
To prevent this space from appearing abandoned, the maintenance by technical services would remain similar in time spent but oriented towards a search for diversity of habitats, shelters, and covers. An experience animated by floristic and faunistic surveys by city agents. This space could also host plantings by schoolchildren from the neighborhood. This strip is 250x13m wide, a great opportunity!

Implementation modalities - Technical opinion:
Creation of a ""garden in motion"" on the impasse de la Charbonnière, along the vegetated strip bordering the railway. The concept of a garden in motion is inspired by the principle of fallow land, where maintenance efforts are kept to a strict minimum. The goal is to let the plants evolve on their own, in favor of urban biodiversity. The site in question could accommodate about twenty additional trees (including fruit trees), shrubs (flowering and small fruits), as well as a natural flower meadow of 1,000 m². Actions in favor of biodiversity and educational purposes could also be carried out (late mowing, wood piles to create insect refuges, participatory plantings with schools from the neighborhood...)."
143;2022;Motion sensor street lamps South canal bike path;Hello, Modify the streetlights currently present along the bike path between the southern bypass (pedestrian and bike bridge over the Bypass) and the border with Ramonville (another jurisdiction that could also be consulted) to make them lighting fixtures that activate at dusk (also taking into account the change from summer to winter time), and only in case of detected movement on the pedestrian & bike path surface, for a duration sufficient for the time of travel. Advantage: saving electricity and securing pedestrian-bike traffic. Budget: do not replace the existing streetlights, but equip them with an effective motion detection system. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Equip the streetlights of the bike path along the Canal du Midi (southern section, from the Canal des Herbettes bridge to Ramonville) with shape detectors. Shape detection allows for controlling the operating costs of lighting by providing light only in case of confirmed use of the public space. It involves detecting the presence of human movements at night.
21;2022;Noise and speed radars on the Barcelona Alley/Twin Bridges;"We need noise and speed radars on the Barcelona alley in front of the school, and the Canal du Midi between Pont Béarnais and Ponts Jumeaux: too many vehicles with tampered exhausts accelerate without respecting speed limits, make maximum noise, and destroy the sleep of local residents. This would also reduce noise in the city center through peripheral controls at the city entrance. I do not understand how it is allowed to drive in densely residential areas, assaulting citizens at all hours with tampered, hyper-noisy, and lung-polluting exhausts. The whole city is concerned; the noise from motorcyclists/scooters invades the Prairie des Filtres from the Quai de Tunis, just as it invades the Parc de Ramiers and the terraces of St Cyprien. Their noise is no more appreciated in green areas or in the countryside... with the correct pipe, these vehicles would be silent. I hope that we will regulate the noise level of these non-compliant vehicles, either through radars/fines, vehicle technical inspections, or prohibitions of access to noisy vehicles in the city (in the same spirit as the restrictions for polluting vehicles that are developing). Although the ads from the Marie declare 'Toulouse +tranquille', there is still work to be done to get there. Thank you.

Technical Implementation - Technical Opinion:
The type of equipment aimed at penalizing overly noisy vehicles does not exist to date.
However, it is possible to install an educational radar, which, with the help of a luminous panel, indicates to drivers whether the noise level of their motor vehicle is compliant or not.
Annual operating cost: €5,000"
23;2022;Possible Improvements Belfort / Denfert Rochereau District;"Idea submitted via paper form by AL: Refurbishment and greening of Denfert Rochereau street, the roadway is in a deplorable state, remove some parking spaces and create flower beds that we will maintain with pleasure and plant some trees. Thank you.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The creation of green spaces is possible on Denfert-Rochereau street. However, additional investigations (such as geodetection) will be necessary to determine the types of plants to be planned.

The width of the street is limited, and the buildings create a significant built front, resulting in reduced sunlight on the street. The project therefore plans to use parking spaces with low-growing plant species suited for partial shade, shade, and a selection of small trees. It is possible to enhance the area with relaxation spaces featuring seating and planting containers."
64;2022;Limit the lighting of the equipment - Cartoucherie-Zenith;"The lighting on the upper floors of the Cartoucherie car parks (notably P2), which are open-air, is too intense and harmful both for the residents of the area (especially in summer, when windows remain open at night), and especially for biodiversity (it feels like broad daylight). Why not install detectors so that it turns off when the parking is not in use? The same goes for the Zénith car park, which is permanently lit for no reason, especially with older lighting that is even more harmful (in this case, no need for a detector, simply turning it off at night is ideal as it is a closed parking used only for the Zénith).

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Replacing the lighting in the Zénith car park with more modern and eco-friendly LED lighting can be done. However, the part of the idea concerning the silo car parks cannot be implemented as part of this call for ideas, as they do not belong to the community."
167;2022;Multi-Activity Terrain near the Touch;"We could convert the abandoned tennis courts by the Touch into a Multi-Activity Sports Area, which would be greatly appreciated by all the residents and citizens of the ZAC de Saint-Martin-du-Touch. Implementation details - Technical opinion: The creation of a multi-sport field makes perfect sense in the context of the redevelopment of the ZAC Saint-Martin du Touch and the ""Parc du Touch"" project. This proposal could lead to the rehabilitation of the tennis court site by creating a sports area (city stadium)."
94;2022;Installation of mosquito traps in Croix Daurade;"The Croix Daurade neighborhood is among those severely affected by the arrival of tiger mosquitoes. Perhaps it would be possible to install bat boxes, mosquito devices in the neighborhood? Implementation details - Technical opinion: The Animal in the City service draws attention to the fact that bats are active during twilight or at night, and that tiger mosquitoes particularly bite during the day (morning and early evening before nightfall). Bats will consume mosquitoes of the Culex genus, which usually are not the ones that pose the most problems, various flying insects, and a few tiger mosquitoes. This is not a miracle solution, especially since the tiger mosquito is now part of the food chain. Thus, the ""massification"" of bat boxes will not eradicate the tiger mosquito from an area. This solution must be used pragmatically. It is part of the preservation of biodiversity and the ecosystem approach but it is not the most appropriate for combating the tiger mosquito. Other solutions such as oviposition traps should be prioritized because they intervene at a key and unavoidable stage of the tiger mosquito's life cycle and are specific to this species. The installation of oviposition traps in public spaces is therefore proposed, 40 traps for 1,200 euros."
8;2022;Greening the bases of trees in the city;Hello, I propose to green all the tree bases in the city center with plants. Implementation details - Technical opinion: The scale of the city center mentioned at the end of this idea is too vast to carry out such a project within the framework of the participatory budget. The technical services propose to implement this idea on Rue des Arts, subject to the study of underground networks and the opinion of the Architecte des Bâtiments de France. It is possible to plant perennial ground-covering plants and occasional shrubs to add volume to the layout and beautify the space.
67;2022;A playground in the Barry garden;Just like the beautiful wooden boat at La Daurade or the pretty dragon (also in wood) at Place St-Georges, why not create a lovely play structure in the Barry garden, in the same style as the boat and the dragon. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Creation of a monumental wooden playground in the Barry garden. The playground could be designed to be as inclusive and enjoyable for everyone.
105;2022;Insects and Birds in the City;"Hello, There is a lot of talk about green spaces, planting trees, water, etc., to combat climate change. We can't just talk about that; there is also life around these elements. In sector 4.1, as in the rest of the city/metropolis, there are private or public green spaces that can be arranged to facilitate the lives of birds, bats, insects, particularly bees. In sector 4.1 we have the Lapujade gardens, the observatory, the heights of Bonnefoy, Rous, Méricant, Michelet with its pond that must be preserved, the cemeteries of Terre Cabade and Salonique, among others that I have forgotten. There are green spaces that are not public gardens but can be part of the process. Each species having its own specificity, birds dropping some seeds here and there, bees pollinating flowers, bats taking care of mosquitoes (among other things), it would be good to make their lives easier. My idea is to equip these green spaces with birdhouses, bat boxes, insect hotels, beehives, and water points, so that this fauna can develop and humans can encounter a wilder animal life than our domestic animals. The negligible cost of these actions compared to other proposals, all equally interesting but more expensive and localized, can be extended to the entire metropolis. Sector 4.1 can serve as a trial area for this massive implementation, then be extended. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: It is possible to equip certain green spaces in the district (Hauts de Bonnefoy, Pierre Rous Observatory, Michelet) with birdhouses and insect hotels. Regarding beehives, this depends on the exact location as the placement of beehives is regulated by a prefectural decree setting strict rules (distances to be respected between the hive and homes). It is impossible to add additional water points given the risk of mosquito proliferation. Regarding bat houses, the Direction of Animals in the City is reserved on the effectiveness since bats are active at dusk or at night while tiger mosquitoes particularly bite during the day. Solutions such as breeding traps are more effective in combating the tiger mosquito. If this idea wins, birdhouses and insect hotels will be installed in four parks in the district (24 birdhouses), and breeding traps will be installed to combat the proliferation of mosquitoes."
108;2022;Installation of composters in the city's schools;"Installing composters in the city's schools to raise children's awareness of good ecological practices, significantly reduce the amount of waste processed by municipal waste services (1/3 of our waste is compostable), provide fertilizer for the schools' green spaces, and finally, to comply with the 2015 Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, which mandates the generalization of source sorting of biowaste by 2025.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
It is possible to equip public schools in the district with composters. However, the installation of these devices is subject to the commitment of the educational team to maintain the composter."
47;2022;Create an urban forest on the wastelands of the former Darty;Since the AZF disaster, this land has been a wasteland where grass and poplars grow amid the remnants of tar. I propose instead to plant trees with species native to the region, which would absorb a small portion of the CO2 emitted by the adjacent ring road and would create a cool spot in this heavily concreted area. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Development of a micro urban forest along the ring road, very close to the Robert Baden-Powell Roundabout. It should be noted that at the location of the former Darty, part of the land does not belong to the community, so the micro forest could only be planted along the bike path.
79;2022;Negreneys Street: Transportation for all: continuous bike path, safety for pedestrians, and speed reduction.;"Negreneys Street connects Borderouge to the canal. Recently, the section near Minimes has been successfully rehabilitated,
But from 123 to 170 Negreneys Street, this portion is abandoned by cars! And dangerous for other users: micro sidewalk, no bike lanes, and especially a double lane for cars.
Intense and high-speed traffic: The section between Louis Bréfeuil roundabout and BVD Pierre and Marie Curie is a huge transit point where converge: E. Renan Street from Izards / Av Bourgès (from Borderouge). Michl Ange Street (Croix Daurade), R Pierre Cazeneuve, and Chemin Cordeau (from the Canal + Av Pierre and Marie Curie).
Currently, the double lane, the influx, and the speed are such that it is very dangerous to cross this portion: Proposal: speed bumps + marked pedestrian crossings.
The two sidewalks are completely discontinuous and tiny: impossible to pass a stroller, or for two pedestrians to cross without stepping onto the road: Create a continuous passage zone;
Bike: Borderouge and the south of Negreneys are equipped with bike lanes, connecting the city center by soft transport. Multiplying the daily users that I am, and the occasional ones with the bike-toulouse stations post 252 & 151): no bike lane! Forced to ride on the double lane or on the sidewalk already too narrow for pedestrians in both directions: Proposal: creation of a bike lane to connect the neighborhoods, and secure it.
Intersection of Cordeau Street and Negreneys (135): A vegetated and wooded area: little used because of the glass deposit + box the Relay, both regularly overflowing. Proposal: move these deposits to the paved area for a reappropriation of this space.
Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: Feasibility in several phases: Phase 1: tactical bike lane in the direction of traffic from No. 170 to No. 123: completed in March 2022 Phase 2: tactical two-way bike lane to be scheduled in autumn 2023 Phase 3: bus corridor and bike lanes by the end of 2028"
100;2022;Kiosk at Michelet Garden;"To bring a little more life to the beautiful Michelet garden, why not install a kiosk or even a guinguette, to invigorate the park which is not sufficiently utilized? The park could also host certain events since there are no outdoor events in the Bonnefoy neighborhood. The kiosk could sell drinks and snacks for on-site consumption and could serve as a venue for events such as concerts or exhibitions. The potential of this park is currently untapped, and the suburb still lacks a must-visit gathering point like some neighborhoods have. For now, it is merely a passageway to the city center.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
This suggestion emerged during the consultation on the redevelopment of the Michelet garden. The Michelet Garden is classified as a Wooded Classified Space. Classified areas cannot be built on to accommodate a permanent kiosk or bar (creation of a building). However, a mobile and seasonal refreshment stand (bike-movable) is feasible and would be consistent with the tranquil use of a garden. This year, a first experiment took place in the garden."
63;2022;Greening Avenues Biarritz & Casselardit;"The Biarritz & Casselardit Avenues connect the banks of the Garonne to Avenue Grande Bretagne; they are wide avenues bathed in sunlight, featuring large sidewalks, bike lanes, bus and car zones. There is existing space for planting to reduce heat islands, beautify the living environment, and reduce visual and auditory pollution from the nearby ring road. Implementation details - Technical opinion: The greening of Biarritz Avenue can be carried out to reduce heat islands in this area, lower high summer temperatures, and beautify this axis. The greening would be done on some parking spaces, and about 15 trees could be planted. Additionally, the markings could be revised to improve the readability of the bike lanes. However, regarding the same project on Casselardit Avenue, the avenue is very narrow and currently has no cycling facilities. Therefore, a more comprehensive project for this avenue needs to be considered. This part of the idea will not be feasible within the framework of this call for ideas."
189;2022;Greening of Place des Tibaous;"During its construction, Place des Tibaous replaced one hectare of greenery with one hectare of concrete, without a trace of greenery or shade (according to the theory of the previous mayor, who believed that a hectare of concrete is cheaper to maintain than a hectare of greenery). The result was immediate: unbearable heat in summer, including for the many buildings constructed around the square, which are living through hell. The square is deserted by residents, and businesses are dying. It's a place everyone avoids, whereas it should be a hub of life. The city hall's response: creation of car parking spaces—the square has become a living space for... cars. The few trees that have been planted are not watered and die within a few months, only to be replaced by others... which also die. The suggestion: stop putting cars everywhere, make the public space livable for human beings by truly greening this square to turn it into a living space and make the lives of local residents simply bearable.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The greening and planting of Place des Tibaous can be partially achieved, taking into account the need for space for the open-air market. Soil de-sealing can be performed, and trees can be planted. Technical feasibility studies for geo-detection of underground networks must be conducted to determine the locations for tree planting."
154;2022;Nesting Boxes for Tits;The populations of tits in urban areas are constantly declining due to the loss of their habitat. Yet, these birds help reduce the presence of harmful insects. They are particularly welcomed by gardeners as a means of biological control. Arboriculturists concerned with limiting the use of pesticides sometimes place tit nest boxes in orchards so that they eat apple worms and aphids. This technique is also recommended to combat the pine processionary caterpillar. Would it be possible to encourage residents to install tit nest boxes in the same way that Toulouse Métropole has implemented composters for individuals? The supply would be offered at a preferential rate following suitable information. The model visible in the Jardin des Plantes, made entirely of wood concrete, seems very easy to install and maintain. Maintenance: An annual visit to the nest box is advised, in winter, to remove the remains of the previous season's nest. Tits build a new nest each year. It is generally unnecessary to wash the nest box. If parasites have invaded it, the use of detergent is strongly discouraged, as it could be harmful to the birds. Wash with water, possibly with the addition of a neutral pH soap. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Installation of a hundred tit nest boxes in the Saint-Michel, Saint-Agne, Le Busca, Empalot, and Île du Ramier neighborhoods. In addition to promoting the settlement of birds in the city, these nest boxes are also a tool to combat harmful insects, particularly pine processionary caterpillars.
60;2022;Honey in my neighborhood: let's produce sweetness!;"ALIMECO is a non-profit organization founded in 2020 following the health crisis to address the food emergency of families. It serves all residents of the BAFAPATABOR neighborhoods (Bagatelle, Faourette, Papus, Tabar, and Bordelongue). ALIMECO consists of 40 volunteers and one part-time employee and aims to develop food autonomy in these areas. The proposed idea is as follows: 1/3 of our food comes directly from the work of pollinators, which are under threat and tend to disappear due to human practices. To act in our neighborhood in the face of their disappearance, and to reach consciousness at the closest level and from the youngest age, we are launching the idea of creating an urban ""BIODIVERSITY SCHOOL"" space. This project is centered around the establishment of an educational apiary, in accordance with current legislation and respecting the safety of all. The goal is the involvement of residents through interaction, practice, and learning of care for the living, thus for ourselves. Beekeeping gestures and practices, honey harvesting and potting, sowing of melliferous plants that will bloom in the neighborhoods, making beehives, creating vegetable patches and refuges for insects and animals. Let's bring nature and its benefits back to the city, for the interest of everyone!

Implementation modalities - Technical opinion:
This idea develops biodiversity in the city. It thus contributes to the adaptation of the territory to climate change. Favorable opinion under conditions: A more in-depth study by the services is necessary to ensure its implementation."
75;2022;A two-way cycle path between the Airbus Saint-Eloi factory and the Canal du Midi (Chemin du Sang de Serp);"To enhance the safety of cyclists and pedestrians, I propose making the section of Chemin de Sang de Serp between the Saint-Eloi factory and the Canal du Midi pedestrian-only. Today, many cyclists ride on the sidewalks! This is a street where one direction is reserved for cyclists. It is not a case of going against traffic, as is sometimes still believed, but a direction permitted exclusively for cyclists. Several studies have shown that this is a safe arrangement, despite the fact that it can sometimes be daunting on narrow streets. Cyclists and motorists must be cautious at intersections. As an added feature: mark a cyclist crossing next to pedestrian crossings on Boulevard de l'Embouchure.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Traffic counts must be scheduled due to the narrowness of the street and the potential danger it could pose to cyclists. These counts will help determine the appropriate response.

For your information, a study on cycling infrastructure is underway to connect the rear of the Saint-Eloi site to the Canal du Midi (Montmorency Street, Gounod section - Canal). The study on Montmorency with tactical planning costs between €50,000 and €60,000.

This option may replace the previous one if it cannot be implemented."
114;2022;Install bike racks in front of all businesses and green spaces.;"Today, not only is it difficult to cycle in the neighborhoods of Toulouse (due to poor road conditions and dangerous lanes), but it is also often hard to secure one's bike in front of a shop (for example, on route d'Agde or avenue Jean Chaubet) or in front of a green space (Argoulets, the micro-forest of the Giants above the COSEC of Rangueil). The more bike racks there are, the more bicycles there will be, and thus, fewer cars. Implementation details - Technical opinion: This idea is feasible; it is possible to add racks at locations to be determined in the neighborhood."
113;2022;Person with disabilities;"For sidewalks and pedestrian crossings? ALL NEIGHBORHOODS Consider all disabilities: people with reduced mobility, visual impairment, hearing impairment, intellectual disability. Thank you.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
If this idea is selected, it is proposed to improve pedestrian accessibility on Louis Plana street, the central axis of the neighborhood, by adding pedestrian crossings and bringing other crossings up to standard within a maximum budget of 200,000 euros."
73;2022;Bike street in Les Minimes;"Idea: a bike street with speed bumps on Lambic Street. This street is too narrow to allow cars and bicycles to pass in both directions at the same time. On one hand, this street is particularly frequented by cyclists. On the other hand, cars drive very fast on this street. It would be a continuation of the bike street leading to the swimming pool (Impasse Barthe) and would avoid the Paris barrier roundabout. Emmanuelle

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The idea is consistent with the existing arrangements on Avenue des Minimes and the upcoming developments on Avenue Frédéric Estèbe."
62;2022;Joséphine Baker Walkway Development;Redevelopment of the Joséphine Baker alley on both sides of the tram - Shared gardens / military base side: Creation of a bicycle path not shared with pedestrians along the tram, which can be extended with the existing path to the north towards the Zénith stop. - Zénith side: Opening and development of the fallow area up to the walls along the Zénith. Enhancement of the urban art already present on these walls. Creation of a children's playground, a fitness trail.... - At both ends: secure crossing of the tram tracksImplementation details - Technical opinion: Redevelopment of the Joséphine Baker alleys by making a clear distinction between the bicycle path and the pedestrian path, with the creation of a vegetated pedestrian path with low-height trees. Regarding the proposal for a playground and development of this wasteland, this path has not been studied because a facility of this type will be deployed in the Barry garden, in the park of the third phase of the Cartoucherie, and because a total redevelopment would exceed the €200,000 allocated for each idea.
191;2022;Enhancement of the Gironis Tunnel;"Improvement of bicycle and pedestrian safety in the tunnel under the A64 on rue de Gironis, at the entrance to Parc de Gironis:
- Refurbishment of lighting using LED lamps
- Ground markings to delineate the bicycle path on the wider sidewalk to promote gentle modes of transport for bicycles and pedestrians
- Artistic painting in ""street art"" style on the tunnel walls to beautify this space and reduce the risk of malicious graffiti
- Highlighting the Lafourguette neighborhood and Parc de Gironis with a design representing the neighborhood (created by local talents if possible)

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Regarding the security of traffic under this structure, the work to improve the readability of the bicycle arrangement was carried out in July 2022. However, it is not possible to separate the flows on this section as its width does not allow it.

Regarding the beautification of the tunnel, the Toulouse city council has been developing an Open Sky Gallery for several years. The subject and the scale of the work will be more precisely defined by the ""Public Space Art Commission."""
51;2022;Greening our neighborhoods (project studied around Place Émile Male and on the road to Saint-Simon);"Hello, I think that many things can be improved. The first that comes to mind is the issue of the urban environment. We are going to experience increasingly hotter years, and I think these heat spikes will be particularly felt in cities where concrete significantly absorbs heat. Personally, when summer arrives, I often feel like I'm suffocating. That's why I think that greening spaces would be an effective solution to counter the heat. It would create shaded areas, lower temperatures, bring some air, and break up the concrete look. It seems to me that many people long to see nature a bit more present in the city! I live in the Arènes district where, admittedly, a few trees have been planted, but it does not seem sufficient to me. It would be so much more pleasant to see grass, flowers, etc., instead of these concrete sidewalks and paths. Thank you for the time you will have taken to read my idea.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Greening around Emile Male square, and on the road to Saint Simon by replacing some parking spaces near the arenas in order to reduce the concrete spaces and limit the high summer temperatures."
145;2022;De-seal and vegetate the Ducuing/Salade Ponsan intersection;"The intersection at av. Ducuing/Salade Ponsan is oversized with 2 large, impermeable, and unnecessary central reservations, and a roadway divided into 3 very wide parts. This layout with very wide angles further encourages speeding. This wasted and paved space deserves redevelopment: - keeping only a two-way lane in a tightened intersection and adding cycling facilities - enlarged sidewalks, especially on the west side - the freed-up space would be de-impermeabilized and greened. It would be an interesting gateway to Pech David, especially with the future Larrey OAP.

Implementation details - technical opinion:
The greening of the central reservations at the Ducuing/Salade Ponsan intersection will be carried out by the Toulouse Métropole Tree Plan during the mandate. Instead, it is proposed to fund a cycling facility on Joseph Ducuing Avenue, as well as on Chemin de Pouvourville. These facilities would take the form of Shared Central Lane Roadways (CVCB). Note that for the needs of the development on Avenue Ducuing, the longitudinal parking on the side opposite the Faculty of Medicine would be removed."
116;2022;Creation of shelters for wildlife;The creation of shelters for bats, birds, and insects. Recreating an urban food chain that will have the advantage, among others, of reducing the presence of mosquitoes. Implementation details - Technical opinion: This project is feasible, if the idea is approved, installation of twelve birdhouses at the Argoulets site and at the Jardin du Bout du Monde in Amouroux, and an insect hotel at the Argoulets. Regarding the bat houses, the technical analysis by the competent authority notes that their installation does not provide a solution to the problem of tiger mosquitoes, which are active during the day, whereas bats are nocturnal. Therefore, it is proposed to install breeding traps instead.
65;2022;Greening of the roundabout at Avenue de Lombez, Boulevard Gabriel Koenings, and surrounding areas;"I live on Lombez Avenue. Every summer, with the intense heat, I notice the lack of trees and vegetation in this roundabout and on parts of Lombez Avenue and Gabriel Koenings Boulevard that lead to this roundabout. There is a significant heat island effect, and one can notice a huge temperature difference between this area and places nearby with trees (see Place de la Patte d'Oie or the trees on one side of Lombez Avenue). Moreover, there is space in the concreted areas between the sidewalks. Concurrently, the recent reform of Gabriel Koenings Boulevard has hardly added more trees, and in summer, the same sensation persists; you could remove some parking spaces and also plant more trees. Nothing is more innovative than trees, while maintaining the bike lanes. Thank you.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Greening and de-impermeabilization of one of the parking lots on the Lombez barrier to limit heat islands in summer and to beautify this very concrete axis. Urban furniture could also be installed to make it a convivial space. A consultation will be organized with the residents to think more precisely about the project and to lead a collective reflection on reducing parking capacity."
82;2022;Plan secure bike paths to connect the Sept-Deniers district to Ginestous.;"Currently, to make the connection there is nothing, except to go on the road which is heavily used by many cars, heavy trucks. The young people who go climbing at the Sport Block'out gym have to pass through two roundabouts called Lublin-Lebrère and then Degon. It's very dangerous! A roundabout by definition is very dangerous for a cyclist!

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The establishment of the network must be done in stages so as not to exceed 200,000 euros in the long term. Some sections could be carried out as part of ""My Ideas for My Neighborhood""."
109;2022;Creation of an Alley in the Soupetard Roseraie district - access - between Rue Louis Plana and the Guillaumet district;To date, no human communication to the future Guillaumet district from the East-Plana sector is planned. The municipality owns 2000 m2 between numbers 147 to 151 on Louis Plana Street. This location has been granted a demolition permit but no construction program. These plots are at the altimetric level of Louis Plana Street, which is 2 or 3 meters lower than the Guillaumet site. Before any future program (or sale to a developer), it is optional to plan access via a sloped alley connecting Louis Plana Street (a pedestrian passage) to the recreational area of the future Guillaumet district. Minimal investment given the overall parcel setup. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: This idea allows a connection between Louis Plana Street and the Guillaumet Site.
196;2022;Fruit trees;Fruit trees in the St Simon neighborhood and surrounding areas, to bring greenery and to watch the trees grow in order to taste the fruits. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: The planting of an orchard can be considered at the Gironis park or at the sports facilities on Liffard road, near the school. However, a soil pollution analysis must be conducted before launching the project on the selected site. These trees can be maintained by municipal services, and the orchard will be self-managed by the residents. Educational information panels can be installed to indicate the best practices for picking.
4;2022;Uritrottoir in addition;"Even though it is regrettable to have to install urinals in the middle of the city to regain some collective hygiene, it works well at Saint Pierre and La Daurade. I therefore propose extending the initiative to Rue de la Bastide. Indeed, the street has become an open-air urinal at all hours of the day. It is deplorable for those who live there but also for those who merely pass through. There is space to put one.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Following numerous requests from local residents, a uritrottoir was installed at 3 Rue de la Bastide. It has been operational since May 24, 2022.

However, it is possible to install others in the surrounding streets (Saint-Pierre square area).

Note: operating cost (emptying and maintenance): €6,000/year.
Purchase cost: €7,000."
166;2022;A Health Trail along the Touch;We could change the aging Health Trail along the Touch in the ZAC de Saint-Martin-du-Touch, which is located by the Touch, for the well-being of the local residents and citizens. Implementation details - Technical opinion: This project is timely with the development of the ZAC Saint-Martin du Touch as the area is poorly equipped with nearby sports facilities. In response to this idea, a new fitness station comprising 10 modules could be installed at this site.
131;2022;The development of car sharing;Hello, In order to continue reducing the presence of cars in the city, it is necessary to develop car-sharing stations on the outskirts. Indeed, neighborhoods in the commune of Toulouse and along the ring roads are neglected, which necessitates having one's own vehicle for short trips. We can easily imagine that with a dense network of car-sharing stations across the Toulouse Métropole communities and by increasing the fleets available at major termini, the use of cars where public transport is available will be significantly reduced. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Creation of three car-sharing stations distributed across the Pont des Demoiselles - Ormeau - Montaudran - La Terrasse - Malepère neighborhoods. The community will study the most relevant sites for installation so that these new spots are used to their maximum potential.
66;2022;Fruit tree in the parks;"Hello, We see many plane trees along certain roads or in parks. They are indeed resilient, provide shade, and do not have low branches that could be troublesome for pedestrians and cars. But would it be possible (firstly to plant more, but especially) to also plant fruit trees? Particularly in parks where the fruits are not at risk of falling onto a road and obstructing traffic. Apples, pears, apricots, cherries, or plums would likely grow best as there is a strong production of these fruits north of Toulouse. Passersby could harvest the fruits for their own consumption. They certainly wouldn't be as high-quality as commercially available fruits but they would have the merit of being available to everyone. Alternatively, we could consider planting them in schoolyards, but that's another idea. Sincerely

Technical Implementation Details - Technical Opinion:
This project involves planting fruit trees or a fruit hedge in the Barry garden, around the future community garden planned as part of the garden's renovation. Thus, a free picking would be accessible to the neighborhood's residents."
201;2022;Shade veils over public outdoor playgrounds for children;"Several playgrounds for toddlers and older children are in full sun in Toulouse:
- Place Saint Georges
- Place Occitane
- Raymond VI
- Borderouge
- Jardin Niel
Other examples are possible! Scorching slides, heat strokes... they are impracticable... The city hall could quite easily install high suspended shades attached to poles as is done in Portugal or Spain to provide shade.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
A relevant idea for playgrounds lacking natural shade. The Borderouge playground could be suitable for experimentation. A more detailed costing and placement will be specified if the idea wins."
117;2022;Suggestions for Composting Sites;"There could be a compost site at the corner of David Elbaz Street and Avenue Henri Guillaumet in the neglected triangle area. There could be a compost site along the Argoulets path near the TGBT, where the surroundings are left abandoned. There should be one or more compost sites within the future headquarters. There could be a compost site near the community gardens at the end of Léon Bourgeois alley. There could be a compost site at the top of Genêts Street near the garden. The demand is real, as are the expectations.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Location 1: at the corner of Elbaz Street / Avenue Guillaumet, this location is not recommended: the compost site must be located in an environment that offers a minimum of comfort and attractiveness for the community of residents who will manage the composting site, in a spirit of conviviality. The location, surrounded by traffic lanes, is very exposed to car traffic, and not secure for users, does not present the convivial character expected for a composting site.
Location 2: Argoulets path near the TGBT, this site is conceivable provided that a collective of at least 30 volunteer residents is formed.
Location 3: compost sites are planned within the Guillaumet eco-district.
Location 4: there is already a compost site within the shared garden on the hill.
Location 5: Genêts Street, subject to finding the necessary thirty households and their collective commitment to manage the composting site, it is possible to install a compost.

Note, to install composters it is necessary that at least 30 households volunteer to start the project and prepare the collective organization (through consultation times).

If this idea is voted on, the installation of community composters can only be done on the condition that 30 households volunteer. More information on toulouse-metropole.fr."
182;2022;"""OASIS"" schoolyard redevelopment at Victor Hugo Elementary School";"The playgrounds of the Victor Hugo elementary school in the Bellefontaine neighborhood are in need of renovation. Transforming these playgrounds into cooler, more pleasant, and better-shared spaces would improve the well-being of the neighborhood's children. It would be advisable to create more natural spaces, with more vegetation, better management of rainwater and water features, more playful and child-appropriate facilities, quiet corners, and a better distribution of space. These playgrounds could become ""cooling spaces"" also used by leisure centers, especially in July and August. These ""Oasis"" playgrounds would truly come into their own during the increasingly longer hot periods. Implementation details - Technical opinion: An oasis playground envisages different arrangements from those usually undertaken in schoolyards, with wooden furniture and games, plantings of perennial plants, trees, and shrubs, and areas of bare soil covered with wood chips. The playgrounds of the Victor Hugo schools, like about fifty playgrounds out of the 210 school playgrounds in the city, are potentially identifiable as future oasis playgrounds. The success of this project also depends on the mobilization of the site's professionals."
93;2022;Reducing Noise Pollution;"The noise pollution caused by the densification of the neighborhood is becoming very problematic and a hindrance to living well together. Two-wheelers are the main source (excessive speed, tampered engines and exhausts). Would it be possible to conduct an awareness campaign and install noise radars (Chemin des Izards, Route de Launaguet, etc.)?

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Currently, there is no penalty radar for vehicle noise. However, we can install an educational radar, which, with the help of a light panel, would indicate to drivers whether the noise level of their motor vehicle is compliant or not. The budget is 30,000 euros for investment, plus 5,000 euros per year for operation."
127;2022;A beehive in the city;This idea was submitted via a paper form by DMP. As an amateur beekeeper, I would like to establish an apiary near the community gardens of Toulouse/La Plaine. This apiary could serve as an opportunity to raise awareness among the neighborhood residents about the preservation of bees and their importance in the ecosystem. Setting up a small apiary could also provide an opportunity for activities with the neighborhood and with other beekeepers. Implementation details - Technical opinion: After analysis by the services, it is feasible, provided that the requirements imposed by the prefectural decree are met, to install this equipment.
48;2022;Sports Circuit around the Garonne;Hello, I would like fitness stations to be installed along the Garonne, near Avenue de Muret. Indeed, on the Empalot side, they already exist. The idea is to create a circuit, especially in connection with the future footbridge. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Creation of a fitness trail along the Garonne through the installation of various sports modules to promote physical activity in this area.
57;2022;Solar panels on the Bagatelle Neighborhood House;Today's ecological situation requires a significant development of renewable energy production, particularly with solar panels. To avoid encroaching on agricultural land, building roofs should be equipped. The roof of the Bagatelle Community Center is large (400m2) and allows for the installation of a substantial area of photovoltaic panels, thus generating a considerable capacity (80KW) (and if this is not possible, there are also other public buildings available). The goal is to create a sense in the neighborhood that we can progress in the ecological transition, alongside other actions, so that everyone, residents and various stakeholders, become aware of renewable energies and embark on the ecological transition. We propose that panels be installed on the roof and that a screen be placed in the entrance to continuously display the power being produced at the moment, and the energy produced since the beginning of the year. The Bagatelle Community Center is a highly symbolic place, where family celebrations and many associative activities and diverse meetings of the residents take place. It is the neighborhood's house. It is important that it leads the way in ecology and thus drives the neighborhood forward. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Installation of solar panels on the roof of the Bagatelle Community Center. Should there be technical constraints, they could be deployed on the Clément Falcucci School Group, the Georges Hyon Elementary School, or the Desbals Cultural Center.
129;2022;Street Workout Area - Boisseraie Park;To promote sports practice and physical fitness among residents, it would be interesting to install a street workout area (pull-up bars, horizontal ladders, parallel bars, wall bars, push-up bars, etc.) in the Boisseraie park. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Installation of sports equipment in the Boisseraie park.
54;2022;Development of Fontaine Lestang Park (Les Biscottes);"Optimize the Parc Fontaine Lestang (known as the Biscottes) while preserving wild spaces. Expand the play area for children by improving visibility towards the center of the park and rethink the games for older children (a new play area was set up 2-3 years ago but it attracts children aged 5 to 7)/ there is nothing for teenagers. For example, from the most modest to the most ambitious: ping pong table, basketball hoop, skate park, pump track, more benches and tables, arranged nooks... This park offers many possibilities (large space, large trees) but the residents of the neighborhood focus on 1/4 of the park because the rest is less accessible. Why not a shared garden space where residents could plant flowers and vegetables with the children? Thank you for moving the dog park.

Implementation modalities - Technical opinion:
Development of this park through the installation of ping-pong tables, picnic tables, and additional benches. However, the larger proposed infrastructures – skate park, pump track, and even the shared garden (and the paths that come with it) - cannot be considered because the park is classified as EBC (Classified Wooded Area), which does not allow for the mineralization of additional spaces."
10;2022;Sheer curtains of shadows over public outdoor playgrounds for children;"Several playgrounds for toddlers and older children are in full sun in Toulouse:
- Place Saint Georges
- Place Occitane
- Raymond VI
- Borderouge
- Jardin Niel
Other examples are possible! Scorching slides, heat strokes... they are unusable... The city could quite easily install high-hanging shades attached to poles as is done in Portugal or Spain to provide shade.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
From a technical standpoint, it is not possible to plan such an installation at the playground located at Place Saint Georges, due to the height of the structure.

As for the playground at Place Occitane (or play area), which is located on a building slab, it is not possible to create foundations, which are essential due to the forces that would be exerted on the poles by the sails during strong winds.

In the city center, the other playgrounds are all shaded by trees (Place du Salin, Pays d’Oc, Carthaillac, Square de Gaulle...) with the exception of the one located at Port-Garaud.

If the idea wins, it will be implemented at the Port Garaud site, subject to prior approval from the Architecte des Bâtiments de France."
14;2022;Watch over illegal dumping sites;"Toulouse is a beautiful city. To preserve the beauty of Toulouse, there are numerous places where the people of Toulouse can dispose of their waste. The city also provides a service (which works very well) to take care of bulky items. However, some residents continue to recklessly dump their waste along the boulevards. This is the case along Boulevard de la Marquette (near Ponts Jumeaux). Our proposal: to experiment with the installation of a network of cameras on the upper part of Boulevard de la Marquette (near Ponts Jumeaux) which would, on one hand, monitor wild dumping to have it cleaned up and, on the other hand, if identification is possible, to educate the ""budding ecologist"" by pedagogically explaining that there are other solutions for managing waste than wild dumping.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
With the help of cameras, a report is made through Allo Toulouse to the relevant Toulouse Métropole service for collection. It should be noted that the public space supervisors and the agents of the Brigade Against Incivilities also make reports to this service when they observe such incidents."
107;2022;Missing section of the Lapujade cycle path;It would be safer (especially with the work on Faubourg Bonnefoy and the diversion of vehicles) to create a bike lane on the missing part of Chemin Lapujade. That is, from Rue Paul Pujos to the Rond Point d'Afrique. Chemin Lapujade (from Intermarché to Chemin de Lanusse) deserves to be redone following the various works that have taken place. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: The creation of a bike lane is not feasible on Chemin Lapujade since it would require making the road one-way, which is not feasible before the completion of the metro works (2028). Therefore, it is proposed to carry out a tactical arrangement, namely a Shared Central Lane Roadway, which will secure cyclists using the road while waiting for the implementation of a permanent arrangement.
42;2022;Community Composting/Participatory Garden - Croix de Pierre;Propose a communal composting for the Croix de Pierre neighborhood, and/or a community garden (on the Île du Ramier or any other location capable of hosting such a project) in connection with the use of the compost. (or composting alone) Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: Installation of a collective composter in the Croix-de-Pierre neighborhood on Route d'Espagne, subject to the involvement of at least 30 households for it to function. The location can be defined in consultation with the residents.
45;2022;Free the trees' feet on Avenue de Muret and Route d'Espagne;"On the section of Muret Avenue between Croix de Pierre Square and the September 21st Roundabout: - delineate wherever possible spaces for greening around trees (2mx2m for example) by removing the asphalt and creating areas bordered by small wooden markings (+/- 20 cm high). Proposal of seeds by the City Hall services and freedom for residents to plant ornamental plants or others. On the section of Spain Road between the September 21st Roundabout and the ring road: - remove the asphalt covering between the trees of the central median. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: Greening of the widest central medians on Spain Road in order to reduce the concreted areas on this axis and fight against heat islands. However, numerous constraints only allow for moderate development (presence of networks, presence of plane trees with roots and risk of spread of colored canker, reduced maintenance capacity). Regarding the greening of Muret Avenue, this track was studied in proposal 1450: ""Greening Croix de Pierre."""
99;2022;The ornamental fruit tree;This idea was submitted via a paper form by molac26. Instead of planting ornamental trees, let's plant fruit trees to be harvested by schoolchildren for school cafeterias and volunteer associations. Benefits: organic fruit for the cafeterias / discovery of fruits by children / reduction in cafeteria costs / local food supply. Drawbacks: planting fruit trees. Implementation details - Technical opinion: This idea is feasible at the Cazal stadium sports complex with about thirty fruit trees. This space is freely accessible and can be used by local residents provided the trees are respected.
74;2022;Educational garden;"From the very first month, children are sensitive to many things. Such a place would be a formidable educational space and a true exploration site. It would help develop their environmental awareness. It would also be a space where early childhood professionals could express themselves, initiating creative activities. This place would be accessible to early childhood professionals as well as to parents and grandparents who wish to participate. This environment would be an essential lever to meet the fundamental needs of babies (cognitive, emotional, psychological, and language expression). Contact with nature conditions the development and well-being of a child, especially for a city child. Such a place would foster their curiosity, construction, and flourishing. Beyond even gardening, the garden and nature are tremendous spaces for creativity. Such an environment perfectly allows for the artistic and cultural awakening of young children. Nature indeed provides children with unique learning opportunities, whether in terms of engagement, risk-taking, discovery, mastering situations, self-esteem, and creativity. Each early childhood professional will draw ideas on how to integrate nature awareness, creativity, and culture, and the history associated with it, into their daily practice. A variety of projects could be developed there, all connected by the concern to make this place a space for opening up to creativity, enriching the young child's environment, and building connections in the neighborhood. ""The period from conception to the first two years of life after birth are crucial for the development of the child and the health of the adult they will become"": according to the report of the first 1000 days.
Implementation modalities - Technical opinion:
This idea is feasible at the Parc de la Vache. The competent municipal service could support the choice of plant palette and major maintenance, but it would be appropriate to involve a community actor for regular and educational management. This idea will therefore be conditioned on this organization."
200;2022;Art on the blind walls;"The idea would first be to identify the blank walls in the city and propose large-scale artworks for them. The photo of Claude Nougaro at Saint Pierre is one example, but there are also many large cities that offer murals. Introducing art into everyday life, not just in museums. The people of Toulouse and tourists could take photos in front of them and promote the city via social media. Implementation details - Technical opinion: The Toulouse city hall has been developing an Open Air Gallery for several years and offers street art tours with the tourist office. Any new creation can be integrated into the constantly evolving routes. The subject, location, and scale of the artwork will be more precisely defined by the ""Public Space Art Commission."""
70;2022;Public Toilets at the Jardin du Barry;"Barry Garden is a green lung for the Cartoucherie district, a densely built-up area, as well as for the surrounding neighborhoods. This garden is expected to see an increasing number of daily users, with the many residents of the Cartoucherie Eco-district (3,525 housing units eventually), almost all living in apartments, who need to get some fresh air with their children, or who go jogging or walk their dogs, but also with the attendance during their breaks by students from nearby schools, by office workers, including for lunch. These uses of the garden are growing throughout the year. Not to mention the parties and friendly and family gatherings on weekends and the use of barbecues between May and October. It will also increase at all times of the year, with the installation of a multisport field and the reappropriation of the garden by the residents. This reappropriation of the garden as a place for walking, meeting, or sports practice requires better cleanliness of the garden, which is only possible if toilets are available. Indeed, the use of the garden is currently spoiled by the lack of public toilets (natural need of children and adults, as soon as one spends more than an hour and a half in a garden) and by wild toilets (with paper and human excrement) that have been installed in every corner of the garden. The installation of PRM toilets at Barry Garden meets a neighborhood need and can benefit the greatest number. It is part of the actions supported by the Toulouse City Hall for a greener and more breathable city. The proposal is multiple and complementary:
- Request #1 concerns the installation of autonomous public toilets with vermicomposting in Barry Garden. Without the addition of sawdust, these toilets are designed to be used without any water or electricity network and without chemicals (saving 12,600,000 liters of potable water per year). The sober design and the exterior wood materials allow it to fit well into the environment and its use requires no supervision. These toilets could democratize and simplify the use of so-called ""dry"" toilets. They are used like conventional toilets: the user presses a pedal to roll out an inclined mat. Thus, the materials are sent to the back of the building and are gradually transformed into compost by the worms (both saprophagous - they consume decomposing plants - and coprophagous - they feed on fecal matter). Thus, there is no need to add sawdust or straw, which limits the evacuation of compost to once every 5 to 15 years. The operating cost is almost nil: 1 intervention per year in the technical room is necessary, emptying is only rarely carried out. Ex: in 2020 SANILIGHT model at Colomiers - Perget lake / In 2017 Union Park including a picnic area, playgrounds, and a stadium (www.sanisphere-fr.com) Budget: from €21,000 to €30,000 depending on the substructure to be planned.
- Request #2 concerns the installation of a self-cleaning sanisette near Barry Garden, on the parking lot facing Barry Garden or on Suzanne Noel street next to Barry parking. The location outside the garden is inspired by other large Toulouse gardens that do not directly host a sanisette in the garden but nearby on a street. It is a capital expenditure normally eligible for the participatory budget, the rental and maintenance costs are the responsibility of the city, like the 63 public toilets already installed in Toulouse. Since the toilets are self-cleaning, there is not much cleaning to plan, but rather the replacement of consumables. To make this system more ecological, it would be interesting to replace potable water with non-potable water (near the parking lot by collecting rainwater / near the garden, by lake water after filtering). Budget: installation cost of €10,000 to €20,000 per cabin Rental €25,000 annual
- Request #3 – installation of urinals To solve the problem of wild urination at Barry Garden and transform this incivility into a powerful 100% organic fertilizer: the urine is collected and valued by the plants in a vegetative mass filled with Chabazite (volcanic rock). The biomass of the basin, the adjacent land, and the plants feed on this fertilizer, hence accelerated growth. see ECOSEC - http://parisette.coop Budget: VESPALITE model - budget to be specified
Technical implementation details: Installation of public toilets with vermicomposting in Barry Garden. This highly advanced technology can accommodate a significant number of users while being aesthetic and perfectly odorless."
188;2022;Guilhermy Neighborhood City Stadium;"Having lived in the Guilhermy neighborhood of St Simon for 18 years, I am in a position to say that this ever-evolving neighborhood lacks any playgrounds or recreational areas for children and teenagers. Hundreds of residences and buildings have just been constructed, but nothing for the youth. For over 15 years, we have been requesting a City Stade so that everyone can have a safe place to have fun. To this day, they play in the streets, in front of our houses or apartments, with all the insecurity that entails. Even the young teenagers no longer have a bench to sit and chat on. Everything was done properly in the Tibaous neighborhood, but nothing on our side. This playground or City Stade is a real necessity.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Given the proximity to the freely accessible play areas of the Ramée leisure base, the installation of freely accessible sports-health equipment, sports modules, near the school group is recommended. The presence of a city stade leads to noise disturbances for the residents."
98;2022;Sports equipment;"I would like outdoor ""weight training"" sports equipment, freely accessible, installed either along pedestrian paths or in the Jardins du Museum, thus in greenery and shade. TROIS COCUS - BORDEROUGE area.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The Maourine park can accommodate 3 pieces of equipment on its part 3, but not a significant sports structure. The cost per sports structure is 5,000 euros, making it 15,000 euros for the three."
83;2022;Intergenerational sports and recreational area around a pump track;"Why an intergenerational playground? Because it's good to play together! Good for health, both physical and psychological, good for solidarity and living well together. And intergenerational? Because adults should play too, relieve stress, reduce tensions, get to know their neighbors. And why a pumptrack? This sporting activity is fun from ages 2-3 up to 80 years old. A pumptrack allows for non-polluting sports, can be surrounded by greenery, and even other balance or gym workshops, which will amuse both young and old. Sports and outdoor activities generally lead to a more positive mindset. People come together and communicate through sports. Our family has visited several pumptracks: the atmosphere is always welcoming, people talk to each other, eager to share. Often, you find families bringing young children, and parents get tempted to take up a sport they had set aside, sometimes in the busy routine of commute, work, kids! Also, it's a ""rising"" installation: more and more are being built, the popularity and use of these structures continue to grow. Toulouse will inevitably consider it, so why not in our neighborhood? The family-friendly Sept Deniers neighborhood has the same spirit as the pumptrack: dynamic, intergenerational, supportive, caring, and respectful of nature. You will find a link to a manufacturer following: www.bikesolutions.fr. There are others. Thank you for the attention you pay to the citizens. Sincerely,

Implementation Details - Technical Opinion:
This idea is feasible; it is necessary to identify a land to carry out the project. If the idea were to win the call for ideas, a consultation would then be launched with the neighborhood associations and residents to select a site for installation. This development is estimated to cost between €150,000 and €200,000 depending on the length and width of the track (€100/m2)."
81;2022;Develop the Parc des Sept-Deniers with an ecological fitness trail;"I propose to develop the Parc des Sept Deniers by installing an ecological fitness trail (made from recycled plastic).

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The Community does not yet have this type of equipment in its public procurement. However, it is possible to quickly install wooden equipment that could integrate perfectly into the environment as they are placed directly on the green spaces. The cost is approximately €2,500 per apparatus."
159;2022;Development of a hall at Bertier Square;"Install a market hall in Bertier Square, Saint-Martin-du-Touch district, near the ""Demain"" sculpture. An open wooden structure with a tiled roof. This hall, commonly found in city centers, aims to provide a meeting and exchange place, but also to allow local producers to sell their produce or to host a second-hand market or events. This responds to point 3 of axis 4 of the PCAET.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
A soil survey study must be conducted to confirm the feasibility of this project and its final cost. Furthermore, Bertier Square is undergoing a quality of life improvement initiative called ""Heart of the District."" This initiative will include a consultation phase with residents and users of the public space as part of the market hall project."
148;2022;Neighborhood map at metro exits;At the metro stations and the bus shelters at the Linéo stops, there is only a Tisséo network map that does not allow one to orient oneself, or a map just for connections. There is a lack of a neighborhood map to find one's way, locate a nearby street, along with facilities and services. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Installation of neighborhood panels indicating places of interest (historical monuments, health establishments, public facilities ...) throughout the districts of Saint-Michel, Saint-Agne, Le Busca, Empalot, and l'Île du Ramier.
90;2022;Install a pollution filter at Place Job;"I propose installing a pollution filter at Place Job. Indeed, this square is one of the most polluted spots in the Sept Deniers neighborhood (see Atmo Occitanie maps). This tree could be identical to the one installed on the Allées Jean-Jaurès by the Toulouse company Kyanos (https://www.midilibre.fr/2020/10/24/a-toulouse-un-arbre-nouvelle-generation-pour-lutter-contre-la-pollution-de-lair-9159686.php), but there are also more design-oriented concepts that align with the architecture of the Batiment Job. (e.g., Bio Urban: https://www.demotivateur.fr/article/le-biourban-un-appareil-revolutionnaire-capable-de-depolluer-autant-d-air-que-368-arbres-21750)

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
An experiment with this type of device has been conducted in Toulouse and has demonstrated that the device works. It is quite effective for micropollutants. However, for CO2, it is necessary to target particularly exposed areas (urban environments), which is the case for Place Job near the Route de Blagnac."
78;2022;Rehabilitate the Minimes Dead End;The Impasse Des Minimes, located between the Boulevard de l'Embouchure on one side and the Avenue des Minimes on the other, has been neglected. At the Boulevard de l'Embouchure, the lack of facilities and maintenance leads to almost daily illegal dumping. The same lack of facilities also results in vehicles parking (day and night) despite the prohibition. The lack of maintenance causes potholes, and the gravel thrown up by cars damages the doors of ground-floor residences. The impasse (on the avenue side) is not cleaned and serves as a public urinal and picnic area, with the nuisances that this entails. On the Avenue des Minimes side, cars park in front of the entrance to the impasse. Given these observations, considering the immediate proximity of the renovated Avenue des Minimes, the departmental council, the location within a historic monument perimeter, and the recurring incivilities, I propose rethinking this impasse and making it one-way. I also propose greening it as much as possible. In short, beautifying it so that it is not a second-rate artery in the Minimes neighborhood. All this can be done in stages, respecting the allocated budget. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Consultations are ongoing with local residents for making it one-way and adding a double cycle lane. The final arrangements with greening are feasible.
124;2022;Public Toilets Bois de Limayrac;Create public toilets in the Limayrac woods, preferably close to the children's play area. Implementation details - Technical opinion: This idea is feasible.
22;2022;Securing pedestrians;"Sidewalks are used by bicycles, and even motorcycles. It is necessary to design and establish bike lanes to ensure the safety of cyclists and especially pedestrians. Cyclists may use car lanes (in 30 km/h zones) and bus lanes, but the prohibition of using sidewalks is not sufficiently visible and is never enforced. Some bike lanes are marked but poorly signaled and not respected. More bike racks should be installed. Implementation details - Technical opinion: In the absence of a precise location and considering the reports received by the services, it is proposed to study the safety enhancement of Lacrosses Boulevard in particular. Constraints: preserve the functionality of the bus lanes as well as the number of lanes, maintain the numerous parking spaces for the benefit of residents and merchants. Observations: bike racks are present but concentrated in the area of the administrative city and the entrance to the Compans Cafarelli metro station. Objectives:
- recalibration of road markings in favor of a wider bus/bike lane, along the entire length, on both sides of the boulevard, with reinforced ground marking
- proposal to remove a traffic lane between Béarnais Street and Sébastopol Street
- gain of space between Béarnais Street and Marshal Leclerc Boulevard with the removal of the central island."
18;2022;Speed control on Allée de Brienne;The speed limit is set at 50km/h on Allée de Brienne, but once past the radar at the twin bridges, this limit is often no longer respected, leading to noise pollution, increased pollution, and danger. Proposals: trigger the red light at the mid-canal footbridge if the speed is exceeded, installation of speed bumps on the ground. Implementation details - Technical opinion: The system of a punitive or rewarding traffic light is not currently feasible as it is not regulated in France. The few pieces of such equipment in the Toulouse Métropole area are currently out of service. The installation of a second punitive radar falls under the jurisdiction of the State. However, the creation of a speed bump platform at the intersection of the footbridge is entirely feasible. This crossing would also help secure the passage of bicycles so that they can join the existing cycle network in the side lanes of Allée de Brienne.
202;2022;Increase the Installation of the Algal Tree in Toulouse;This air purifier is a beneficial device for the air quality in Toulouse. Its installations must be increased, especially in strategic areas of high air pollution such as Matabiau station or the Basso Cambo metro station. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: The algal tree is an air purifier made of microalgae, with an absorption capacity equivalent to 50 trees. The experiment conducted by Toulouse Métropole in 2020 has demonstrated that the device works and is effective against micropollutants. To have an impact on CO2, it is necessary to target particularly exposed areas (urban environments generating high concentration, slow dispersion). An opportunity analysis of the site must complement the deployment of this solution in the district.
121;2022;Dry toilets in the green zone of La Plaine;"Dry toilets along the Plaine line, between Chaubet and Castres roads, with signs indicating the existing toilets, open to the public but hard to find (those located between the Cité de l'Espace and the Plaine playgrounds).
Implementation details - Technical opinion:
This idea is feasible."
146;2022;Installing speed bumps on Avenue Albert Bedouce;Speed bumps or a radar should be installed on Albert Bedouce Avenue because cars drive too fast. We live in a residence at the intersection of Lauragais Avenue and Albert Bedouce Avenue, and every day we witness speeding, skidding, and acceleration at the traffic light. Some cars race all the way to Saouzelong metro station. It's a meeting point for dealers. There are already several speed bumps on Lauragais Avenue and also a radar. We have children, it would be safer for everyone. Thank you in advance, Mr. Mayor. Technical Opinion - Implementation: Installing speed bumps on Albert Bedouce Avenue is a feasible proposal.
92;2022;Greening the Croix Daurade cemetery parking lot;"The parking lot at the dead-end of Croix Daurade cemetery is a large puddle of asphalt; it made sense when it accommodated the school buses, but today the time has come to green this asphalt puddle: parking slabs with grass and trees 🌳 would greatly benefit the environment of our neighborhood. Implementation details - Technical opinion: An operation aimed at greening and thus de-asphalting the current parking lot, this requires maintenance due to its degraded state."
183;2022;The WorksParc, an outdoor sports complex, at the intersection of several disciplines (Street Workout, Chase Tag, Parkour);"Today, the lack of freely accessible outdoor sports facilities impacts far more people than one might think. For about fifteen years now, myself and several other residents have been forced to travel 3-4 km (sometimes much more) just to do our daily sports sessions (bodyweight exercises, not necessarily in a gym). The travel itself is not necessarily the problem; it can actually be a strength, but the main idea is to invigorate the neighborhood, which is an underutilized asset. We would have preferred to enhance the image of La Reynerie through training sessions or group events where everyone could participate according to their own schedule. But also to improve the image of the neighborhood, which has seen athletes like Benyamine El Ouafi emerge, who is now a member of the Chase Tag UNITED team (World Champion 2019 - Vice Champion of France 2021), and who is a true product of these bar sports. This could be a project where both the young and the less young would be maintained in a healthy, sportive atmosphere at the heart of the La Reynerie neighborhood. Finally, this project directly concerns about fifty young people in La Reynerie, but also in the larger Mirail area and the city of Toulouse.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
This idea is relevant to the neighborhood, in line with the Urban Renewal Project of La Reynerie. A freely accessible worksparc could be installed as part of the future sports course that will cross the neighborhood."
138;2022;Make Rangueil Avenue one-way and a 30 km/h zone.;"Rangueil Avenue is a heavily trafficked thoroughfare, causing noise pollution, environmental pollution, and an increased risk of accidents as it cuts through many residential areas. It would be more pleasant to make it one-way from Jules Julien Avenue towards Rangueil, to avoid traffic flowing towards the beltway. By redefining the residential parking area, it would be possible to increase the number of parking spaces. This would be a real advantage for this rapidly expanding neighborhood. Have a good day.

Implementation details - Technical opinion: The establishment of a 30 km/h zone on Rangueil Avenue and the study for making it one-way are feasible."
180;2022;Reynerie-Bellefontaine neighborhood nursery-garden;"To support the ""fertile district"" project of the metropolis, we propose to establish a ""neighborhood nursery-garden"" in the Reynerie-Bellefontaine area, which will aim to produce a variety of young plants (annuals, perennials, and woody plants) to meet the sustainable greening needs of this neighborhood, and more broadly of the metropolis, which must combat the loss of biodiversity and contribute to diversifying our diet by rediscovering the use of forgotten plants. This production will be emancipated from fossil resources, autonomous thanks to the plant material from the conservatory garden, and participatory with the involvement of residents, particularly the neighbors, as well as through partnerships with nearby stakeholders to make the activities and products accessible to the most vulnerable people and the youth of this neighborhood. We aim to establish the site on a plot of land degraded by human activities, in order to demonstrate the potential for enhancing the landscape and living environment of the residents, through our actions (soil regeneration and greening, social bonding, economic dynamics, etc.).

Implementation modalities - Technical opinion:
The community may temporarily provide a developed plot connected to water, in the southeast sector of Reynerie. This project involves developing wastelands to allow for cultivation (provision of the land, irrigation work, fencing and furniture, installation of water and electricity points), and a call for projects will need to be launched to find an organization to manage this nursery."
101;2022;Greening the surroundings of the Marengo-Périole schools;"It would be interesting to explore the possibility of greening the areas around the Marengo-Périole schools (elementary and kindergarten). Particularly the access path that starts from rue Périole and serves the 2 schools, the cafeteria, and even the middle school. The development of green walls could be considered, as well as the landscaping of the slope between the school and the cafeteria. Several options could be considered, in consultation with the schools, the parents, and the residents of the neighborhood. Some projects could involve the participation of the children.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
It is possible to plant 6 to 10 trees depending on the presence of networks (3 trees in the massif on rue du Maréchal Gallieni + 3 trees in the massif near the cafeteria in the school group + 2 or 3 trees on the slope of rue de Périole.)
The creation of green walls is technically possible but very expensive."
35;2022;Installation of public toilets between Arènes station and Carrefour Lombez;The pedestrian underpass that connects the bus stop to the other side of the tracks (Pasteur Clinic, Carrefour Lombez, McDonalds on Blvd Gabriel Koenigs) is regularly used as a restroom. To make this passage (especially the wheelchair-accessible ramp) less dirty and repulsive, it would suffice to provide the people who frequent this area with the opportunity to use proper, dignified restrooms. Installing public toilets at the exit of the passage on the Blvd Koenigs side, in the green square next to the benches, seems to be a solution for this unappreciated neighborhood. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Installation of a uritrottoir, an ecological public urinal, on the green space located near 36 Boulevard Koenigs, at the exit of the underpass leading to the arenas. Due to technical constraints, a self-cleaning public toilet cannot, however, be deployed in this area. For your information, there is a self-cleaning public toilet nearby at the level of the arenas.
161;2022;Adding Trees to the Roman Arenas Neighborhood;"Planting additional trees in certain areas of the Roman arenas district, such as on the green spaces near Carlos Gardel Street, near the Bayonne road, or on the small grassy plot located at the edge of Jaufre Rudel Street, behind the Purpan shopping center (I even thought that at this location, a small public garden or wooded public green space could be created, like those near Carlos Gardel Street).

Implementation details - Technical opinion: The proposed lands on C. Gardel Street and J. Rudel Street are private spaces, their acquisition by the community would exceed the budget envelope of €200,000 allocated to each project. On the Bayonne road, the areas adjacent to the natural spaces that would be suitable are already planted. Tree planting is possible in the Roman Arenas district but outside the perimeter mentioned in this idea. A consultation could be proposed to the residents on this idea."
24;2022;Bike rack;"The use of bicycles is clearly on the rise; the number of racks for parking one's own bike is very insufficient throughout the city center and near markets. On Sunday morning, during the St Aubin market, it is really a struggle to find a place to lock up one's bike! The sidewalk barriers on all the surrounding streets are not enough; one must make do with the grilles of basement windows, a pole, a fence, a tree guard...

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The issue of bicycle parking in Michelet Square is a recurring problem. However, given the use of the location and especially because of the market, no additional spaces are conceivable. Installations are possible on adjacent streets, but this will not meet the specific needs of this square. Spaces in the underground parking can also be considered.

In the case of a space on a parking spot only marked by lines, preliminary road works are necessary.

To enhance the offering at Saint Aubin Square, it is proposed to install 19 additional racks at 4 distinct locations on the adjacent streets."
165;2022;Art on the blind walls;"The idea would first be to identify the blank walls in the city and propose large-scale artworks for them. The photo of Claude Nougaro at Saint Pierre is one example, but there are also many large cities that offer murals. Introducing art into everyday life, not just in museums. The people of Toulouse and tourists could take photos in front of them and promote the city via social media. Implementation details - Technical opinion: The Toulouse city hall has been developing an Open Air Gallery for several years and offers street art tours with the tourist office. Any new creation can be integrated into the constantly evolving routes. The subject, location, and scale of the artwork will be more precisely defined by the ""Public Space Art Commission."""
164;2022;Place trash cans at all bus stops;I take the bus every day to go to work, and many of them do not have a trash can next to the stop. This poses a real problem when you need to throw away your trash before getting on the bus (packaging, cigarette butts, etc.) Implementation details - Technical opinion: This idea is consistent with the Cleanliness policy of increasing the number of bins. A census will be conducted at the neighborhood level to precisely identify the interventions to be carried out.
15;2022;Improvement of the playground at Mady de la Giraudière square;"Mady de la Giraudière square is a meeting place for families from the Bazacle and Amidonniers neighborhoods. The installation of public toilets near this park would help keep the area clean. Lighting for the playground and picnic tables would also be appreciated until 10 pm to ensure the area can be enjoyed safely.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
This square and its playground indeed provide a pleasant meeting space for families. To improve the use and appearance of the playground, it is proposed to redo the soft surfaces (currently heterogeneous) of the playground. The addition of one or two picnic tables can also be considered. However, lighting the playgrounds could lead to misuse of these particular spaces, which must remain ""protected"" at night from any inappropriate and disruptive festive activities, causing nuisances for the local residents. The installation of a public toilet nearby can be studied, depending on the technical constraints (networks) of the area."
97;2022;Creation of a blind football field in Borderouge;It would be good to create a blind football pitch in this beautiful pink city, which currently has none. This would allow blind football enthusiasts to practice their favorite sport under optimal safety conditions and independently. The initiative would be very interesting because it would be one of the only blind football pitches in France. Implementation details - Technical opinion: A blind football pitch can be likened to a city stadium. Estimated cost of 120,000 to 150,000 euros. It can be equipped with inflatable walls to prevent any risk of injury. If the project is selected during the vote, a consultation would then be organized with the project leader and the residents of the neighborhood to select a site for installation.
28;2022;Greening of Agathoise Street;Certain oversized public parking spaces and sections of sidewalks should be greened to provide coolness and make this street less austere. Implementation details - Technical opinion: The principle of removing parking spaces in favor of green spaces is entirely feasible on this street. Additional investigations (such as geodetection) will be necessary to determine the types of plants to be used. Rue Agathoise has a narrow profile with a mineral street and numerous resident accesses. The gas network is present under the current parking. The creation of greened islands with low strata adorned with shrubs or structures allowing for the planting of climbers is possible.
147;2022;Development of the vacant lot behind the Pouvourville school;Next to the Jean-Pierre Vernant school in Pouvourville, there is a vacant lot that is regularly mowed by the city council but not utilized. Unfortunately, it only serves as a place for dog waste... I therefore propose that this area be enhanced by the city council by creating a children's park, community gardens, a city stadium, ping pong tables, in short, a real place of life where both young and old could gather. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Enhancement of the space through tree planting and the installation of wooden play structures allowing both residents and students to enjoy a natural space that respects biodiversity, on the space adjacent to the Jean-Pierre Vernant school.
133;2022;Mural depicting the history of Montaudran;Mural depicting the history of Montaudran (Aéropostale, space, Latécoère factories...) under the new bridge at Montaudran station. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Creation of a mural on the wall of a shaft in Montaudran. A mural evoking the history of Montaudran, located under the shaft near the Envol des Pionniers, is already in the process of being created. Consequently, the City of Toulouse will find an alternative site, still within the Montaudran area. The subject, as well as the location and scale of the work, will be more precisely defined by a committee composed of municipal elected officials and the artist(s) selected by the community for the realization.
198;2022;Place trash cans at all bus stops;"I take the bus every day to go to work, and many of the stops do not have a trash can nearby. This poses a real problem when you need to dispose of your waste before getting on the bus (packaging, cigarette butts, etc.)

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
24 bus stops are recorded in the Compans-Amidonniers district.
The busiest stops are already equipped with bins that have extinguishers.
It has been estimated that about twenty stops remain to be equipped in this district."
152;2022;Play area accessible to all at the Pays d'Oc garden;There is no playground for disabled children in the neighborhood. Our association, Le Busca, our neighborhood, proposes to install a playground for disabled children during the development of the Rond-point des Français Libres, which would allow easy access to this space for caregivers. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Installation of a playground for children with reduced mobility at the Jardin du Pays d'Oc. The installation of a playground at the Rond-Point des Français Libres had not been authorized by the Architects of the Buildings of France. Alternatively, it is possible to fund a playground accessible to all at the Jardin du Pays d'Oc, in addition to an already significant playground, to allow children to mix with each other.
13;2022;Aesthetics of Recycling Bins;In Céret in the PO, I saw a great idea: dressing up recycling containers with photos. Since you praise the work of Dieuzaide in Toulouse, could this be an idea? I can provide a photo... Implementation details - Technical opinion: An experiment could be proposed on a few containers using royalty-free archive photos of the neighborhood. The total cost of such a project has been estimated based on 6 containers.
175;2022;Installation of game tables at Place des Pradettes;Pradettes Square (Camille Poinas Square) is a meeting and exchange place frequented by associations and residents of the neighborhood. Thus, living together is one of the fundamental values of our village-like neighborhood. To further promote this sense of community and to improve our living environment, the installation of a chess table and a table suited for board games would allow residents to enjoy this lovely square in a fun and constructive way. Moreover, neighborhood residents already gather daily to play dominoes in the square. These tables could replace one of the aging picnic tables or be added in addition to the existing street furniture. These new pieces of furniture would be in line with the square's enhancement plan. Implementation details - Technical opinion: The project is coherent and technically feasible, the Garden and Green Spaces department proposes the installation of 2 chess tables or other models.
158;2022;No more benches in the streets;I suggest that benches be added in all neighborhoods, with sufficient density to allow all those who tire easily to continue going out and walking with the assurance that they can rest regularly. This would contribute to the preservation of the autonomy of elderly people. For example, I often see an elderly couple walking in my neighborhood, taking uncomfortable breaks on garden walls or other window ledges. Similarly, my grandmother stopped going to the post office on foot because she had to make the round trip in one go, whereas with a break, it was entirely possible for her. She has thus become dependent on us to go there... Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: A census and a diagnosis of the urban furniture in the neighborhood will be carried out to precisely identify the interventions to be carried out. About twenty chairs could be installed, especially in front of public facilities, the busiest bus stops that are not equipped, on the greenway.
197;2022;"Install a ""swallow nest tower"" in a green area in the heart of the Lafourguette district.";"Several sources alert us to the dramatic decline in the swallow population over two decades. Climate change disrupts their migration, while urbanization and the artificialization of soils strip away the natural elements necessary for nest building. Yet, swallows are an essential link in biodiversity: they can eat up to 3,000 insects per day. We have identified two initiatives in the Occitanie region that could be replicated in our neighborhood on an experimental basis, before being rolled out in other districts of Toulouse.
- The installation of a ""swallow tower"" in Auch, a project led by the Groupe Ornithologique Gersois
- A project for compost-bin birdhouses in urban areas led by the Jeune Chambre Economique de Montpellier"
53;2022;Shade Greening on Rue Jean Mermoz;"Jean MERMOZ Street is bathed in sunlight from morning to evening. In summer, it becomes a real furnace. This street is used by the users of the MERMOZ metro station. It would be interesting to create a green canopy to reduce the heating of the street and provide some shaded comfort to pedestrians and residents. Planting trees could certainly be a solution, but to reduce the footprint on the ground and to more easily control the shade, it is proposed to implement structures that support climbing plants. These modular structures with climbing plants can be placed so as to cover the sidewalks and parking areas, or even cross the street to form a wide screen of foliage. This arrangement can be conducted in stages to assess the feedback and then be extended to the entire street and other sites. Rainwater management could be associated with it to irrigate the planting areas.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Greening of Jean Mermoz Street through the installation of green pergolas on the southern part along the hedge, which would provide shade while limiting ground impact. Also, tree plantings could be carried out on the northern part by replacing some parking spaces."
130;2022;Canigou Street Park Development;This green space is underutilized. It would be interesting to install some playground equipment for children (slides, swings...) and one or two ping-pong tables. Implementation details - Technical opinion: To improve the park located on rue du Canigou, it is proposed to install equipment such as a ping-pong table, chess area, and reading nook, to allow for quiet outdoor activities alone, with family, or with friends. The creation of pathways to make crossing the park and its use comfortable (with elevated work to preserve the tree roots) as well as work on the garden entrance, to make the created pathway accessible to everyone, are also proposed. Finally, the installation of children's playground equipment will be considered.
20;2022;Making recycling bins glamorous;"What if we made the glass recycling bins in Toulouse more beautiful? These bins are scattered throughout the city. They are practical but not very glamorous. The idea would be to combine art with recycling and beautify these bins by painting them, using green as the main theme. We could involve local artists, associations, and schools. Who knows, it might even turn into a ""touristic"" trail around the city.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
An experiment could be considered on a few containers with artists who could be selected based on visual proposals. The total cost of such a project has been estimated based on 10 containers (2 artists and 5 containers per artist considered)."
33;2022;Saint Nicolas Street, artistic and ... flowered?;"Saint Nicolas Street in the Saint Cyprien district (31300) is a busy street between Place de l'Estrapade and Port Viguerie/Garonne. Close to Toulouse Plage, it is the street of artists. Here, one can find ceramists, an ""ART"" sewing workshop, a Latin cinema shooting/meeting workshop, designers, painters, a hairdresser, etc. Let's preserve the authentic and bustling soul of this street as well as its beauty by re-greening it as much as possible. It would be enough to place flowers on the barriers, green the sidewalks and/or the edges of the buildings, and install structures that can hold flowers, etc. THANK YOU.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Greening of Saint Nicolas Street through various means. By greening some facades using metal trellises as support for climbing plants, with the installation of vegetated poles on the ground, by replacing some parking spaces with greenery as was done on Rue de la Chaine in Toulouse, and by greening the space behind the church statue. Metal wires between buildings, with the agreement of the owners, could also be installed to enhance this greening."
61;2022;Ashtrays at bus / metro / tram stops;"Hello, It is distressing to see that in 2021 people continue to throw their cigarette butts on the ground before taking public transport. That is why I think it is necessary to install ashtrays at every bus/metro/tram stop. I suggest using the format of the ""boîtes à clopes"" from Caen in the busiest locations. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Deployment of 30 ashtrays around the bus stops in district 2.4 so that people do not throw their cigarette butts on the ground before taking public transport."
140;2022;Create marked parking spaces on Avenue des Coteaux;"Vehicles parked on Avenue des Coteaux do not comply with alternate-side parking and are parked on both sides of the street. This significantly slows down traffic, and since it is unclear which side has priority depending on the fortnight of the month, it is difficult to ease traffic flow because it is not known who has the right of way over the oncoming vehicle. It seems to me that if this street had designated parking, alternating for example, we would have more respectful and smoother car traffic. This is particularly striking for Avenue des Coteaux, but it also applies to many residential streets in the neighborhood (Avenue des Pivoines, Edelweiss, etc.). This might also help alleviate congestion at the traffic light at the intersection with Route de Narbonne, especially in the morning, to allow vehicles turning right not to build up in the queue of vehicles turning towards the ring road.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
Resurfacing the roadway on Avenue des Coteaux. This would also allow for the demarcation of parking spaces on the ground on Avenue des Coteaux to encourage users to comply with alternate-side parking, combat illegal parking, and relieve congestion at the traffic light intersection with Route de Narbonne. Finally, a bike lane could also be marked on Avenue des Coteaux to maintain a continuous cycle route between Route de Narbonne and Chemin de la Salade Ponsan."
199;2022;Place trash cans at all bus stops;I take the bus every day to go to work, and many of them do not have a trash can next to the stop. This poses a real problem when you need to throw away your trash before getting on the bus (packaging, cigarette butts, etc.) Implementation details - Technical opinion: There are about thirty bus stops in the neighborhood. The busiest bus stops are already equipped. The Jeanne d'Arc bus station stops have been temporarily arranged to allow accessibility for people with disabilities using plastic modules, so they cannot be equipped with bins. Therefore, there are still about twenty bus stops that need to be equipped.
186;2022;Art on the blind walls;The idea would first be to identify the blank walls in the city and propose large-scale artworks. The photo of Claude Nougaro at Saint Pierre is one example, but there are also many large cities that offer murals. Introducing art into everyday life, not just in museums. The people of Toulouse and tourists could take photos in front of them and promote the city via social media. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: Continuing the projects related to graffiti carried out by landlords and Toulouse Métropole in Bellefontaine and the drawing projections on the facades of some buildings in Reynerie, district 6.3 is well equipped in enhancing its facades. This idea could contribute to the concept of a graffiti city in Bellefontaine or the photo reportage project on the Reynerie neighborhood.
95;2022;Greening of the exterior walls of the Grand Selve school;"The walls of this new school are made of raw concrete with a very austere appearance, resembling a prison enclosure, and they store heat. A miserable strip of low vegetation (already overrun by weeds) separates them from the public road. We propose to cover these walls with climbing plants suitable for the exposure, and where it is not possible (in front of openings), to plant trees of the fourth size (up to 5 meters). This will also help prevent tags and other graffiti. Also consider providing shelters for cavity-nesting birds and bats. This arrangement particularly concerns the grand selve alley, Simone Henry street, and Flora Tristan street.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The idea is feasible with some adaptations. It would involve planting larger specimens along the school wall but not climbing plants, which require too much maintenance and thus an increase in operating costs."
104;2022;Caillibens Cycle Path;"Caillibens Road is the only way to cut through the cemetery to connect Avenue de la Gloire and Jolimont. It is used daily by many parents dropping off their children at the École de la Gloire and the Jolimont daycare. This two-way road is narrow, and cars travel fast on it, putting cyclists at risk. My proposal is to establish one-way traffic and use the freed-up lane to install a two-way bike path. Cyclists will then be safe. Motorists going in the prohibited direction can be redirected to Boulevard des Crêtes. Implementation details - Technical opinion: 
It is not feasible to create a bike path, but it is possible to carry out a tactical urbanism intervention known as a Shared Central Lane, which will secure the safety of cyclists."
37;2022;Clarify priorities upon exiting Rue Réclusane;Proposal: Clarify or even rethink the priority rules at the exit of Rue Réclusane. Why this is needed: Cars and bicycles leaving Rue Réclusane onto Allées Charles de Fitte are in principle given right-of-way when entering. In practice, this rule seems to be little respected by those traveling on Allées Charles de Fitte. Moreover, the priority rules between bicycles and cars are not so clear in practice (intersection where bicycles coming from the avenues or bike paths cross or enter towards Rue Réclusane. This can lead to misunderstandings, anger, or even the danger of collision. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Clarify the exit directions on Rue Réclusane and facilitate pedestrian crossing by closing off the intersection and removing the lane dedicated to hospital access. This access, used for emergency entries and some deliveries, could be converted into a sidewalk with limited access to the CHU. Additionally, implementing a Yield sign at the exit of Réclusane onto Allées Charles de Fitte will improve the overall readability.
80;2022;Install chessboards at Claude Nougaro Garden;The installation of chessboards as part of the urban furniture in the garden would be a great asset to this place. Indeed, these tables would allow playing chess and checkers by bringing one's own pieces but would also serve as a meeting point for local residents. They would also enable the youth of the neighborhood to discover these games. Implementation details - Technical opinion: An idea that combines the goal of playing a quiet game while also serving the functionality of a table outside of this activity. The number of tables will be determined based on the replacement of existing significant furniture in this Claude Nougaro garden (3,000 euros per table).
31;2022;Children's playground;"Installation of a playground for young children (slide, swings, etc.) and benches for parents, grandparents, or nannies in this lovely, well-treed square which currently serves as a canine urinal located at the end of rue des arcs saint cyprien, end of rue de cugnaux, opposite the clinic, next to the school near allées Charles De Fitte. And I have not found the name of this little square...

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
One possibility that could be considered is the redevelopment of the Clémence Isaure garden to better adapt to current uses, by planning open spaces that can accommodate a large number of middle school students in a short time and by providing real relaxation areas for local residents and users (through the installation of benches, chairs, and baskets). It should be noted that the garden is a Classified Wooded Area and is located within a Historic Monument perimeter, so the layout will be constrained by urban planning rules and should lean towards a neighborhood garden with minimal facilities, reinforcing the current tree and plant layer and using natural ground materials. The installation of a traditional playground could be realized in this garden, but for your information, a playground has just been built nearby, at the green space opposite the Patte d'oie Kindergarten on rue de Cugnaux."
88;2022;Replace the current traffic lights on Route de Blagnac with reward lights and add new lights at all pedestrian crossings.;"The reward traffic light is a simple way to encourage drivers to adhere to speed limits. The 30 km/h limit on short sections such as those in front of schools is not respected, just like the 50 km/h limit, especially at night. Moreover, a request to limit the entire neighborhood to 30 km/h was made in another proposal, and without an incentive, this proposal will not change drivers' speeds (this is already the case in Paris). Coercive measures are necessary. https://www.lesechos.fr/2003/12/le-feu-qui-passe-au-rouge-en-cas-dexces-de-vitesse-679290

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
A green reward light should never be associated with a pedestrian crossing or an intersection; it must be on a regular section of the roadway. It is possible to consider such a device on the northern part of Route de Blagnac, between the Pierre Mounicq roundabout and the Jean Bégué roundabout."
89;2022;Understanding and better preserving the animals of the Sept-Deniers neighborhood;"It would be beneficial to raise awareness among the residents of Toulouse about the biodiversity in their neighborhood and to encourage them to protect the animal species sharing their environment, such as hedgehogs, small birds (sparrows, tits, wagtails, redstarts...), insects (bees, ladybugs...). To do this, it would be necessary to inventory the species, observe whether their numbers are increasing or decreasing in the coming years. It would also be good to plan for small dwellings in public gardens and private homes for our animal friends.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The community proposes to experiment with this idea by equipping 2 gardens in the neighborhood with birdhouses: Parc Job and Jardin du Soleil d'or are suggested (16 birdhouses in total). Supply and installation of birdhouses: 180 euros including tax per birdhouse, making it 2,880 euros for the 16 birdhouses + approximately 2,400 euros for maintenance per year. In total for the first year = 5,300 euros."
160;2022;Pedestrian crossing lighting;"Along the railway, there is a pedestrian crossing from the Saint Martin du Touch station to a business park with large companies like ATOS, ECA AEROSPACE... It is heavily used at the start and end of the office hours but is unnecessarily lit all night without any foot traffic. This creates visual pollution especially since the light poles are very tall and made of wood. I propose shorter light poles for a pedestrian crossing with LED lights and motion detection to operate at 10% light during standby at night and 100% upon activation. This would save energy and reduce visual pollution. Implementation details - Technical opinion: The technical solution of human shape detection meets all the challenges specific to public lighting: protection of the starry sky, fauna, and flora by providing almost ""zero"" lighting if the space is not in use, yet ensuring safe and reassuring light for potential users at night. This site could benefit from this innovative solution. The deployment goal for the city of Toulouse is to have 30% of the park, or 20,000 devices, by 2030."
171;2022;Bike rack installation in Lardenne;The municipality promotes the use of bicycles in the city, and I support this initiative. Thus, the creation of a bicycle path that connects the Lardenne and Pradette neighborhoods to the Ramée lake is an excellent initiative. It is also important to facilitate the daily use of bicycles, for example, for shopping or sports. Therefore, I propose the installation of bicycle racks near Sauvegrain Square, close to the toilets or on the other side of the street near shops, on Mazagaie road near the public school, in front of the Emilie de Rodat school at the level of the Petit Capitole leisure center... Implementation details - Technical opinion: Bicycle racks are already installed at Sauvegrain Square, and it will be possible to supplement these facilities to meet the demand. A further study, taking into account the configuration of the sites, will identify the possibilities for installing bicycle racks at Sauvegrain Square, on Mazaygues Street, and in front of the Emilie de Rodat school.
120;2022;Games of Ooo in the city;"Urban air conditioning based on the Egyptian principle, an ancient method: terracotta and cool water create a cooling effect. A large terracotta sculpture, a small solar pump, little water (which circulates continuously), the water moistens the earth and creates a ""cool"" effect. Location: Saccarin Park. Feasibility study: forthcoming. Implementation details - technical opinion: The community does not have a public procurement contract for the installation of so-called ""Egyptian climate"" devices, so this idea will not meet the two-year deadline for its realization, and thus this part of the idea is not subject to vote. However, for the part of the proposal that involves installing water play features for children, it is possible to install a misting type device. It should be noted, however, that this park is shaded, and sun-exposed sites are more relevant for this type of installation."
112;2022;Brunaud Alley roundabout, Roseraie district;Rethink the exit layout of the roundabout from allée Brunaud towards roseraie as the curb is often damaged due to very dangerous traffic when overtaking because there is a double lane, and when exiting the right lane, one encroaches on the left lane: practice is better than theory for the layout of roundabouts MAXImplementation details - Technical opinion: This idea is feasible.
85;2022;Build and install a communal bread oven in the 7 Deniers neighborhood.;In order to recreate social bonds around bread-making (which has regained a lot of momentum with successive lockdowns), it is proposed to build and install a communal bread oven in the 7 Deniers neighborhood. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: The construction of a bread oven can be considered, albeit with some reservations and prerequisites. The management of this equipment must be under the responsibility of an individual (physical or legal) to avoid certain nuisances related to potential incivilities. It is not feasible to leave this oven as a self-service facility if it is wood-fired. However, the installation of an electric oven could be considered. It would then be necessary to house this equipment in a closed building (about 8/10m2) to secure it during periods of inactivity. A potential site has been identified: on the public space near the André Chaubet passage.
103;2022;Greening/ redevelopment of Bartoli Square;"Bartoli Square (located next to Lpaujade path) is part of the Lapujade OAP and was intended to be a green space. Surrounded by social housing, the only ""green"" space in this area is this square. However, this square, being exclusively mineral with southern exposure, is absolutely impractical for residents and constitutes a real source of additional heat in the summer for the surrounding housing. Indeed, this square is encircled by an unnecessary road (services and residents have a nearby parking area to turn around), the square itself is covered with asphalt, a bench is located in the center, and only two very young trees make up the only vegetation on the site. To create a cool oasis in this highly urbanized area, and so that this public space can finally be used by the residents, it is essential to remove the road that encircles it, remove the square's pavement, and plant an abundance of evergreen and deciduous plants to combat the heat in the summer and pollution in the summer and winter. A fountain could also be installed to cool the area. Thanks to the shade created by the new plants, additional benches would be welcome as well as playgrounds for children. This plot contained a great biodiversity before being massively urbanized, so plants are essential to once again offer a refuge for biodiversity in this area. Not to mention, a quality public space that residents can finally use.

Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: Subject to the existence of networks constraining the project, it is perfectly feasible to improve the greening of this space. The circular asphalt road must be preserved as it ensures the turnaround of garbage trucks. Consequently, the furniture such as bollards must also be preserved to ensure the respect of the lawn and plantings (by preventing wild parking). The creation of a playground is possible, however, the average surface area of a playground being a small hundred square meters, it would occupy about 1/3 of the available space. In this configuration, a playground could be an opportunity for nighttime gatherings and generate too much noise nuisance for the residents; we advise against a playground in this space surrounded by housing. Consequently, if this idea is adopted by vote, the central space will be greened (without removal of the adjacent roadway and without a playground)."
59;2022;Games for Adults (development of a playground with equipment not solely dedicated to children);Most parks are fun for children, the adults watch, the adults push, the adults chat... It's impossible to use the swings, impossible to use the slide, and why not let children over 12 years old and adults swing, use slides? They don't always want to play sports or rest on a lounge chair. Why not develop this park near the new Papus center. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Creation of recreational facilities for older individuals in the Papus playground area.
190;2022;Public electric charging stations;"Install an electric vehicle charging station in Saint-Simon. The neighborhood is developing, with more and more residences not all equipped with charging stations, especially the older ones. The development of electric cars and the ZFE zone can hardly proceed without communal facilities that serve everyone and can drive the energy transition. There are also street lamps incorporating charging stations, with experiments underway in France, so why not in Toulouse and particularly in Saint-Simon?

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The rise of new electric vehicles and the enthusiasm of users for electric mobility require Toulouse Métropole to continue its strategy of deploying charging infrastructure in a logic of coherence and territorial equity. In the fall of 2022, more than 360 charging points/parking spaces dedicated to vehicle charging (180 charging stations) will be deployed, with nearly a third for rapid or ultra-rapid charging. All details are available on toulouse-metropole.fr

A charging station consisting of 1 standard charging station can be deployed by Toulouse Métropole as part of its Révéo charging network in the Saint-Simon neighborhood on public space, at a location to be determined."
123;2022;Street Workout Area - Pierre Larousse Garden;To promote sports practice and physical fitness among residents, it would be interesting to install a street workout area (pull-up bars, horizontal ladders, parallel bars, wall bars, push-up bars, etc.) in the Pierre Larousse garden. Implementation details - Technical opinion: It is possible to install a street workout area in the Pierre Larousse garden.
194;2022;Install Lafourguette signage panels;"The Lafourguette district is little known to the people of Toulouse and is often confused with La Faourette, even though it is a very ancient village district of Toulouse. Although the residents of Lafourguette have been requesting it since 1980, our district does not appear on any directional signs in southern Toulouse, except at the Eisenhower intersection. We therefore propose that this anomaly be corrected to:
- Facilitate access to our district, at all entry points: Route d'Espagne, A64 interchanges, ring road, September 21 roundabout, etc.
- Allow Toulousains to identify our district

Implementation details - Technical opinion: A survey of the signage mentioning ""La Fourguette"" showed that it was indicated on 7 signs. All signage installed within a community is subject to a master plan previously studied and validated by state services. Its objective is to direct users from point A to point B via the best calibrated access roads and whose size is in accordance with the flow of motorists and the importance of the indicated hub. Each hub mentioned on the signs is classified according to its attractiveness, which is represented using appropriate indicators. For districts: their population (in the sense of INSEE), the number of secondary jobs, and the number of tertiary jobs, associated with their distance from the infrastructure. If the La Fourguette district is not mentioned on the ring road or other major access roads into the city of Toulouse, it is because this hub does not meet the criteria imposed by the regulations.

Given these elements, a ""La Fourguette"" sign can be added at the September 21 roundabout between Route d'Espagne and Route de Seysses."
185;2022;A city stadium for children under 11 years old;"This idea was submitted via a paper form by Nejma for the Reynerie neighborhood - Rue Jean Gilles. The older kids in the neighborhood use the current city-stade, and the younger ones don't have the opportunity to use the existing one because many teenagers occupy the city-stade. A second city-stade would not be too much. + install a protective net -> importance +++Implementation details - Technical opinion: A ball-stop net will be installed between the City-stade and the playground. This type of request for 4-11 year olds is recurring; it is difficult for them to find space on the city stades when they are occupied by the older ones. A solution of a mini-city (Brazilian goals) or another sports equipment could be installed in response to this idea."
179;2022;Increase the Installation of the Algal Tree in Toulouse;This air purifier is a beneficial device for the air quality in Toulouse. Its installations must be increased, especially in strategic areas of high air pollution such as Matabiau station or the Basso Cambo metro station. Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: The algal tree is an air purifier made of microalgae, with an absorption capacity equivalent to 50 trees. The experiment conducted by Toulouse Métropole in 2020 has demonstrated that the device works and is effective against micropollutants. To have an impact on CO2, it is necessary to target particularly exposed areas (urban environments generating high concentration, slow dispersion). An opportunity analysis of the site must complement the deployment of this solution in the district.
122;2022;Friendliness area green space Rue de l'Isère / Rue de l'Invention;Creation of a conviviality area in the green space located at the bottom of rue de l'Isère: tables, benches, picnic facilities, some children's games, ping-pong table. Implementation details - Technical opinion: After analysis by the competent services, this idea is feasible provided that the local residents give a favorable opinion. It is possible to install urban furniture such as picnic tables and benches. The proposal to install a playground cannot be accepted due to the immediate proximity of two recently renovated playgrounds (square Rougenet in 2020 and Grande Plaine which will be completed at the end of 2022). Finally, the services warn about the risk of nuisances caused by the installation of this type of urban furniture near homes.
184;2022;Petit Bois Tavern;"The small wood, which was once a vibrant place of life, has lost its former glory and luster. As a passage between two school sectors and amidst residential areas, it seems pertinent to me to revive the place with a municipal guinguette to foster connections among residents. An effective guinguette from 3:30 PM to 7:00 PM would avoid noise pollution and nighttime disturbances, and provide a place where children can enjoy snacks together with friends. A weekly musical event would also promote cultural access for all.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
The Bellefontaine small wood cannot host a permanent guinguette (creation of a building) due to the preservation of the site and its closure after 9 PM. However, in response to this idea, a solution involving a temporary guinguette (mobile beverage stands movable by bicycle) or a food truck could be proposed on the Maurois wasteland, on key days of the week. The Maurois wasteland will allow for temporary arrangements until 2025. Furthermore, the Toulouse City Hall's beverage regulation specifies the prohibition of alcoholic beverage sales within 50 meters of an educational establishment (Camille Claudel Kindergarten)."
46;2022;Basketball hoops for kids;Idea submitted via a paper form by Véra: In Maurice Bécanne Park, add basketball hoops for little children, as they want to emulate the adults but cannot. There is plenty of space, even for mini soccer goals. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Installation of a “basketball tree” to encourage this activity for the younger ones in Maurice Bécanne Garden.
168;2022;Speed bumps on Chemin du Touch;"I propose the development of Chemin du Touch with speed bumps and a bike lane. Indeed, it is a very busy road, and long enough that some vehicles travel on it well beyond 50 km/h. It is also used by cyclists who do not have a bike lane. I use it, as do my children, every day and the speed of the vehicles is particularly high and dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians. Speed bumps and a bike lane would help make this road safer.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
It is possible to plan the installation of a speed bump on this road. Prior to this, the responsible services will schedule road counts to confirm excessive speeds. However, the creation of a bike lane on this road cannot be considered within the framework of this call for ideas as it exceeds 200,000 euros. Moreover, several cycling projects are planned in the neighborhood: an alternative bike route via the greenway of the arc en ciel and the future express bike network of avenue Lardenne."
55;2022;The convivial and sportive Gironde (development of the Couserans park);Couserans Park, known to locals as la Gironde, is a central hub of life in the neighborhood. However, it lacks facilities that facilitate gatherings and events. Consequently, residents are calling for amenities that enhance community life such as barbecues, picnic tables, and game tables (checkers and chess). Such installations would provide opportunities for creating unifying and friendly moments. In pursuit of this goal, users of the Vestrepain gym - a true center of social connection and well-being - would like it to be renovated and re-equipped to facilitate workshops centered around sports activities. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Development of la Gironde Park through the installation of a ping-pong table, a barbecue, and a chess table. Regarding the Vestrepain gym, it is a private facility, not a municipal one, so this part of the proposal has been set aside.
181;2022;Development of the access road to Victor Hugo Nursery School;"Location: the passage between Rue Georges Rouault and Impasse François Foulquier. This path becomes impassable whenever it rains, which complicates access to the Victor Hugo nursery school, early childhood spaces, and further on, the Victor Hugo elementary school for children and parents. Often flooded, water stagnates in this area until it evaporates.

Implementation details - Technical opinion:
It is possible to redo the existing path, with a preliminary topographical survey to address the altimetry issues causing puddles. The project involves installing a durable surfacing, either asphalt or concrete."
178;2022;Installation of electric charging stations in the HLM/ZFU park;"The ecological transition is underway in Toulouse, but many households, particularly the most modest ones, which therefore have an older-than-average vehicle fleet and benefit from the highest local/national transition bonuses for renewing and scrapping their old vehicle, face a major problem not addressed by the municipality: access to charging stations in high-density residential areas such as public housing/ZFU zones. Indeed, apartment dwellers cannot afford to buy an electric vehicle due to the lack of individual charging stations, making public (paid) charging stations essential in major Toulouse neighborhoods. To avoid monopolizing these stations for the same vehicles, spaces must be reserved exclusively for electric vehicles under penalty of a fine, and charging must be limited to a few hours maximum per vehicle, with the principle of reserving a slot being exploited with a charging credit granted to each vehicle per week on the same station. It is astonishing in 2021 to see that those owning the oldest thermal vehicles and benefiting from the highest transition aids due to their modest incomes are the ones facing the most barriers to electric charging.

Implementation modalities - Technical opinion: The rise of new electric vehicles and the enthusiasm of users for electric mobility require Toulouse Métropole to continue its strategy of deploying charging infrastructure in a logic of coherence and territorial equity. By autumn 2022, more than 360 charging points/parking spaces dedicated to vehicle charging (180 charging stations) will be deployed, nearly a third of which will be fast or ultra-fast charging. More info at toulouse-metropole.fr

In district 6.3, normal and ultra-fast charging stations will be deployed in the park-and-ride near the Basso-Cambo metro station. The IRVE project initiated by Toulouse Métropole this year will potentially identify other short-term charging station deployment projects in the district."
176;2022;Rehabilitation of the Bike and Mountain Bike Skills Course;Next to the Toulouse Véto Agility site, there was Cyclo Gym! Almost all the equipment has been removed, even though there are many users who could benefit from a agility course. Implementation details - Technical opinion: There are no other facilities of this type in Toulouse. It could be interesting to rehabilitate this agility course to assess the existing enthusiasm for this practice.
50;2022;Speed bumps on Boulevard Déodat de Séverac for more safety and tranquility;Even though the boulevard is very well laid out with a designated area for pedestrians/cyclists, it remains heavily trafficked due to the nearby high school and residential areas. Implementing a means to slow down cars would enhance the tranquility and safety of the many pedestrians/cyclists who use it daily. I propose the installation of speed bumps, particularly in front of the Déodat de Séverac high school, to prevent motorists from exceeding 50 km/h. Implementation details - Technical opinion: Installation of speed cushions on Déodat de Séverac Boulevard (in front of the high school) to reduce vehicle speed.
187;2022;Play Area Niki de St-Phalle Square;Niki de St-Phalle Square, being a central spot in the Bellefontaine neighborhood, it would be interesting to create a more lively space with concrete ping-pong tables as there were in the past, before the demolition of the Candilis building, and also the creation of a City Stade with synthetic grass to breathe new life into the Sunday players' meet-ups and children, a sports dynamic. Burst the screens. Implementation details - Technical opinion: The community is working to make Niki de St-Phalle Square more pleasant by removing the asphalt and installing picnic areas. This project could be enhanced, if the idea wins, by installing ping-pong table(s) and changing the surface of the city-stade. This would be relevant and would help to revitalize this square, which will be demolished by 2028-2029.
3324;2022;Bus shelter on Lanusse Road;"This idea was submitted through a paper form by AM.

Install bus shelters on both sides of the street near the Borderouge / chemin de Lanusse retirement home. Line 19 ""Pujibet Stop"" please consider my request."
263;2024;Increase the number of bicycle parking spaces in the city center;Even though notable efforts have already been made, wanting to develop the modal share of bicycles in transportation requires a significant increase in bike parking options, especially in the city center. Parking spaces are very insufficient around Capitole Square, Wilson Square, St Pierre Square, Arnaud Bernard Square, around St Sernin, Carnot Boulevard, Strasbourg Boulevard, Arcole Boulevard, Alsace-Lorraine Street, Mirepoix Street, Pargaminières Street, Rémusat Street, Taur Street, Gambetta Street, etc. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: As part of its urban development projects, the Community systematically integrates fixtures for bike parking. The deployment of urban furniture such as bike racks in the city center is carried out according to the needs reported by local residents and users (requests to the District Mayor or the AlloToulouse platform 05 61 222 222), subject to the opinion of the Architecte des Bâtiments de France and the availability of already very constrained public space. Within this framework, it is proposed to install, at a minimum, fifty bike racks per year in District 1.
320;2024;Renovation of the bicycle path on Edouard Belin Avenue;The bike path on Édouard Belin Avenue is in poor condition and dangerous. Besides being discontinuous and having lampposts in the middle of the path, which increases its hazard. The holes and the surfacing are not conducive to traffic, encouraging cycling on the bus lane. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is acceptable regarding the improvement of the bike path, but as for the lampposts, they are between the path and the road and are LED and adequate.
394;2024;Mosquito control device taking into account the environment in district 5;All Toulouse residents are daily frustrated by the proliferation of mosquitoes. For public health reasons, we do not want to use insecticides. I propose to massively use natural solutions (bat nests, titmouse cabins, etc.). The idea mainly lies in involving the population by encouraging them to acquire these types of natural solutions. The operating mode could be the same as that implemented for composts. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Principle agreement from the city's animal sector. The type of equipment, their number, and their placement will be studied within the allotted time frame for the realization of the idea, namely 2 years from the vote.
333;2024;Rangueil Skatepark Renovation;We are a group of skateboarders and we wish for the addition of features and a complete renovation of the Rangueil skatepark. It is very popular. It is a place that allows everyone to come together, residents of the neighborhood, or those coming from farther districts for the atmosphere at Rangueil. It is also a living space where we meet young people from all walks of life, to exchange and share knowledge... Over time and with increased use, the ramps have deteriorated, increasing the risk of injuries. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The skatepark is in very poor condition and needs renovation. However, since the platform already exists, the amount for the idea remains within the envelope determined by the 2023 participatory budget idea.
265;2024;Resurface the cycle lanes on the Garonne quaysides;The bike paths along the Garonne, Quai Lombard, and Quai Saint Pierre are in very poor condition. Potholes, deformations due to roots... I would like them to be repaired for better comfort and increased safety when cycling on these paths. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The resurfacing of the bike paths can be considered on Quai St Pierre and Lombard (scenario 1), optionally on Quai de la Daurade as it is less degraded (scenario 2). Associated cost for scenario 1: €150,000. Associated cost for scenario 2: €51,000.
249;2024;Increased use of photovoltaic and wind energy on public buildings;I propose the installation of modules combining wind turbines and solar panels on the roofs of public buildings in the district (Lycée hôtelier, training center for health professions, Zénith, etc.) as well as in other districts to supply them with green electricity and thus, accelerate the city's energy transition. French companies offer this kind of service. I should mention that I have no connection with these companies, which I discovered in specialized magazines. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PROVIDE: To be studied depending on the chosen buildings and the surface area.
298;2024;Creation of a contraflow bike lane on Bertrand de Born street (section Canal du Midi / Place Belfort);"I propose the greening and the establishment of a bicycle lane on Bertrand de Born street. This project, in adaptation to climate change, includes: - eco-mobility with the bicycle lane and the removal of parking spaces. Moreover, the presence of 5 private and 3 public parking lots meets the needs of the residents - the creation of green islands (without affecting the networks) is part of nature in the city and biodiversity: creating shade for the summer. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The development of a bicycle lane from the Canal du Midi to Place Belfort can be considered. Such a project would remove about 34 parking spaces, 2 delivery spots, 1 space for Persons with Reduced Mobility, and bicycle parking. The terrace area of an establishment would also need to be modified. However, the greening of the street cannot be considered due to the presence of numerous networks: their diversion requires a budget incompatible with that allocated under this participatory budget. Finally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be proposed to residents to green this street. This initiative, after agreement from the concerned property owners, is subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and pedestrian continuity to be respected. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the technical services of the city hall and the metropolis, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

332;2024;Improve pedestrian access from the Rangueil cable car to the Pech David leisure base (200m);Today, when one wants to go to the Pech David leisure base from the Rangueil Cable Car Station, the route is complicated and not at all signposted. You really need to know the place well to understand how to get there on foot or by bike. Therefore, I propose improving access to Pech David by creating new, clear paths from the cable car station to the leisure base. The paths must accommodate both pedestrians and cyclists. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It is possible to create 200 meters of pedestrian pathway with the maximum budget per idea for my neighborhood in 2023.
335;2024;Wildlife Shelters;The creation of shelters for bats, birds, and insects. Recreating an urban food chain which will have the advantage, among others, of reducing the presence of mosquitoes. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Principle agreement from the City's animal sector. The type of equipment, their number, and their location will be studied within the allotted time frame for the realization of the idea, namely 2 years from now.
299;2024;Pedestrians, bicycles, and buses on Boulevard Riquet;"Calming of Boulevard Riquet by separating uses through the creation of (1) a dedicated bus lane; (2) a bicycle lane (isolated track replacing a car lane on the roadway, using tactical urbanism if necessary), thus separated from pedestrians (who will walk more peacefully along the Canal), as along Boulevard Monplaisir. Development to be created from the Saint-Aubin footbridge (or earlier from the Genes Lougnon barracks) to the Allées Jean-Jaurès. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: In the context of this call for ideas, given the associated deadlines and budget, it is not possible to carry out a development along the entire stretch from the Genes Lougnon barracks to the Allées Jean-Jaurès. However, pending the implementation of the Grand Parc Canal project, which aims to reorganize and secure movements along the canals (pedestrians, cyclists, public transport, cars), and in order to already improve the conflicts of use along the canal and thus the movements of pedestrians, punctual interventions can be considered at the most sensitive spots that will have been previously defined. Also, between the Constantine Bridge and the Riquet Bridge, the development of a one-way bicycle lane could be studied: note that such a development would eliminate about 45 parking spaces."
260;2024;Installation of shade structures on rue Pargaminières;Create shade first. Install shade structures on Rue Pargaminière and misters during heatwaves. All the merchants on the street turn on their air conditioners, thereby raising the street's temperatures. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: To cool down Rue Pargaminières, it is proposed to position a shade structure. However, such an installation requires studies in terms of technical feasibility (anchor tests - attachment structure on the facades, agreement from various condominium syndicates for the installation of the attachments, preliminary work with emergency services). Moreover, the approval of such a project must gather the favorable opinion of the Architecte des Bâtiments de France. Regarding the misters, the study of technical constraints (presence of a potable water source) will define the feasibility of installing these devices.
305;2024;Create a continuity of the Argoulets green flow beneath the Agde road;To facilitate the passage of pedestrians and cyclists under the Agde road, the tunnel under the Route d'Agde should be reopened, thus allowing for the continuation of the greenway up to Rue Vasseur and then Route d'Albi or Parc de l'Union via Chemin de Gabardie. The tunnel exists, as do the spaces for the greenway and the underpass beneath the railway. What is lacking is the political will to implement it. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Acceptable for all soft modes of transport without distinction, with necessary safety precautions, including lighting.
287;2024;Pumptrack Project near the Ernest Renan skate park;The Ernest Renan skatepark is currently in poor condition. However, it has a very good location that could allow it to become a major hub for skating and the youth of Toulouse, in an area lacking in facilities for young people. It could be paired with a pumptrack consisting of a track, a series of bumps and banked turns, usable for many skating sports - longboards, rollerblades, scooters - and accessible to all ages and skill levels. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The size of the pumptrack will be adapted to the available space. The estimated cost does not include the refurbishment of the skatepark, but only the creation of a pumptrack.
294;2024;Massive Greening on Raymond IV Street;"Raymond IV Street is 14 meters wide and currently lacks any greenery. To mitigate the extreme heat on this street during summer, it would be interesting to replace parking spaces with planting pits to accommodate large trees along the entire length of the street, thereby creating a true canopy. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Planting (14/15 trees) in parking spaces may be considered on the odd-numbered side, subject to the approval of the architect of the buildings of France. On the even-numbered side, the presence of numerous networks does not allow for the creation of pits to accommodate trees. This project would eliminate about 15 parking spaces. On the occasion of this redevelopment, the implementation of a bicycle lane on the even-numbered side can also be studied. Finally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green this street. This initiative, after agreement from the concerned owners, is subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and pedestrian continuity to be respected. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the technical services of the city hall and the metropolis, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform. More information at: https://metropole.toulouse.fr/actualites/des-fleurs-sur-mon-mur"
404;2024;Greening of the entire Rue des Fontaines;"Objective of revitalizing the street. Making the street more pleasant, conducive to the presence of life, and contributing to the thermal regulation of the neighborhood (micro-climatic rebalancing). A few simple proposals, whose effectiveness is well established, include: Tree planting and vegetation through adapted strata. De-impermeabilization and reduction of car parking spaces. Biological reactivation of targeted soils. Increase in bicycle parking spaces. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is accepted, subject to feasibility in view of the presence of underground networks. Similarly, the form that this greening will take will be specified according to the constraints of the networks: tree planting, planters with climbing plants on supports, or standard-formed trees. These developments will result in the removal of about 17 car parking spaces. This project will also be submitted for review by the Architecte des Bâtiments de France. Additionally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green these streets. However, the agreement of each owner is mandatory to green their front facade. The owner must also commit to maintaining the pits over the long term. Moreover, this initiative will be subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and the need to maintain pedestrian continuity. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the city and metropolitan technical services. More information at: https://metropole.toulouse.fr/actualites/des-fleurs-sur-mon-mur"
288;2024;Skate park renovation and development of communal lands along the railway track;Since the abandonment of the Biomass power plant project, the lands owned by the city hall along the railway and Ernest Renan Street have been neglected. A comprehensive redevelopment project into quality green or sports spaces for the residents of the neighborhood would be a real added value. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: This idea is somewhat similar to idea 7297, which involves enhancing the sports facilities on Ernest Renan Street. However, it proposes a redevelopment of the existing structures with the creation of a quality green space, not the creation of a pumptrack. Skate park renovation: 200,000.00 including tax + development of the surroundings: 50,000.00 including tax.
289;2024;Installation of shade structures over the children's play area at La Maourine;The playgrounds in Parc de la Maourine are very exposed to the sun. The idea would be to install shade structures above the play equipment, especially the slides, so that they can be used all day long in summer. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal is to install wind-resistant shade structures as has already been done in other playgrounds (Borderouge). At Maourine, given the layout of the playground which includes a significant variety of different modules, a single shade structure will not suffice. Given the investment, the quote will allow for a precise refinement of the potential coverage area.
274;2024;Greening of tree bases on Avenue des Minimes;From the Minimes bridge to the Minimes church, in order to make the avenue more attractive and welcoming and to reintroduce vegetation and biodiversity to the city, the bases of the planted trees can host green shrubs as in other parts of the city. Currently, the bases of the trees are used as dumping grounds for cardboard or garbage bags. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Planting shrubs does not seem suitable. It would be better to favor the planting of ground cover plants (such as rosemary, ivy, periwinkle, sea thrift...). To limit trampling and other damage, the installation of protective fencing is necessary.
315;2024;Improve the cycling continuity on lower Jean Rieux;The intersection at the bottom of Jean Rieux street, where it meets Port Saint Sauveur and the bridge on rue du Pont Montaudran, is a crucial multimodal transition point where pedestrians, bicycles, cars, and scooters intersect, and the traffic is extremely complex and potentially dangerous. I propose a redesign of the bike lanes in this area to better accommodate the various uses and improve access to Port St Sauveur, Jean Rieux, B. Mulé, and Port Montaudran streets. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is feasible at the intersection, near the bridge, with the creation of new ground markings.
242;2024;Planting trees along Jean Brunhes Boulevard;Plant trees along Jean Brunhes Boulevard. There are numerous parking spaces, and some could usefully be sacrificed for this purpose. This would make the boulevard, a route to the promenade along the embankment, more pleasant, and would help reduce the heat effect during the summer period. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: To be studied depending on the congestion of the underground networks. Pending decision: the removal of parking.
388;2024;A place of conviviality in the courtyard of the Le Cratère cinema.;Create a space for conviviality in the courtyard of 95 Grande Rue Saint-Michel, which serves the Le Cratère cinema, users of the municipal hall, and hosted associations: greening, especially with climbing plants, urban furniture (including a bench against the cinema entrance), painted murals particularly in the passage under the porch, additional bike racks, etc. The project could be designed in a participatory manner with the users of this courtyard. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: An improvement project for the site, owned by the city hall, may be feasible. The details of this project will be defined during consultations with the residents and hosted associations.
281;2024;Tree Plantations Parc de la Maourine and Place Froidure;Many trees have died and have not been replaced on Avenue Bourges Maunoury / Place Antoinin Froidure / Parc de la Maourine and the surrounding paths. It would be wise to inventory them and replant resistant species. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Regarding the Park: About fifteen trees have been cut down in Parc de la Maourine for various reasons (health condition, death). It is proposed to plant 2 new trees for each tree cut down, making a total of 30 subjects. The species will be defined. Regarding the surroundings of the Park, a development project is planned on Avenue Bourges Maunoury in which it is planned to plant trees, an additional proposal will be made for Place Froidure.
290;2024;Installation of uritrottoirs in the Belfort/Bayard district;Implement Uritrottoirs in the streets around Belfort Square/rue Bayard (near the bars) to avoid persistent odors and to collect urine in planters to make our streets more pleasant. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Such equipment is already in operation near Belfort Square, at 1 rue de l’Orient. Note that the installation of a Uritrottoir is subject to various constraints: not overly restricting the width of the sidewalk, no underground networks... The notion of acceptability with the residents must also be considered (directly opposite the device, at the corner of streets which could surprise a passerby...). Therefore, locations near schools are to be excluded. For the mentioned area, the corners of Guillemin Tarayre and Agathoise streets as well as Laffite/Bertrand de Born streets are among the pre-identified sites.
311;2024;Arrange traffic on the Guilheméry Bridge for pedestrians and cyclists;Near a large educational institution, this complex and densely frequented intersection is designed only for cars. However, it is also heavily used by pedestrians and bicycles. Currently, due to the lack of clearly defined cycling facilities (as on the Pont Montaudran), sidewalks are increasingly being used by two-wheelers. Let's delineate and secure spaces, so that everyone can move safely, which will also encourage cycling in the city. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A study for a minor reconfiguration of this bridge is underway as part of the project to convert Port Saint Etienne to Grand Rond to two-way traffic, accompanying phase 2 of the civil engineering works (mid-2025 to mid-2026) for the future François Verdier line C station. This will result in a dead end on Rue des Frères Lion. This idea will therefore be part of this study aimed at improving pedestrian, bicycle, and public transport mobility, with a possible upgrade to the traffic lights standards.
251;2024;Organize a mass mosquito trapping in district 20;Every year, mosquitoes are becoming more numerous and prevent us from enjoying the outdoors. Soon we will also have to fight against the diseases they carry. In order to limit their population as much as possible, the municipality could organize trapping through suction or oviposition (during the peak of female activity). This trapping could be installed along the green corridor of the Touch (at a minimum), but also throughout the Arènes Romaines - Saint Martin du Touch neighborhood. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The type of equipment, their number, and their placement must be studied.
256;2024;Installation of bat and swift boxes around Purpan Hospital;In order to promote biodiversity in urban areas and combat the proliferation of mosquitoes, it is advisable to install numerous outdoor nesting boxes for bats and birds in all neighborhoods affected by mosquitoes, such as the Pupan district. It is worth remembering that external building insulation works are one of the main factors in the destruction of nesting spaces for these beneficial species. The cost ranges from 150 to 2500€ per nesting box, depending on the model. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The type of equipment, their number, and their placement must be studied.
400;2024;Greening of Rue de Cugnaux;"Create greening areas (like on the street leading from J Diebold space to Ravelin square) with the possibility to plant trees or set up flowers. And let the local residents maintain them! 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea of greening Cugnaux street has been accepted, provided that the presence of networks allows it. Similarly, the form that this greening will take will be refined according to the constraints of the networks: planting of trees, planters with climbing plants on supports, or standard-formed trees. These developments will result in the removal of about 17 car parking spaces. This project will also be submitted for review by the Architecte des Bâtiments de France. Additionally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green these streets. However, the agreement of each owner is mandatory to green their front facade. The owner must also commit to maintaining the pits in the long term. Moreover, this initiative will be subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and the need to maintain pedestrian continuity. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the city and metropolitan technical services, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

308;2024;"Avenue de la Gloire by the cemetery wall: bringing ""life"" back to the abandoned planters";The cemetery wall is lined with planters abandoned due to chronic drought. However, plants manage to grow there. The idea is to assemble a team of volunteers to plant drought-resistant species (e.g., sedum), maintain them in coordination with the technical services and according to a specification. This is in the same spirit as the teams for community composting (coordinator, training...). In the end, we will have plants in these planters rather than abandoned soil. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Considering the length of the wall, it is possible to refurbish half of the planters within the 2023 budget limit by idea for my neighborhood.
300;2024;Fighting the Invasion of Tiger Mosquitoes in Soupetard;Mosquitoes are a public health hazard and prevent us from enjoying our outdoor spaces. Following the example set by the city council in the Compans-Amidonniers district, there is a request for the installation of oviposition traps in the Soupetard district as well as in all the districts of Toulouse to combat the proliferation of tiger mosquitoes. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Principle agreement from the city’s animal sector. The type of equipment, their number, and their locations will be studied within the allotted time frame for the realization of the idea, namely 2 years from the vote.
382;2024;Renovating Henri Russell Square: a place of life and freshness;"- Reduce the presence of cars: remove car parking spaces around the square, and add bicycle parking.
- Green the square, plant trees, add a water feature, children's playgrounds, and benches.
- Review traffic along Avenue Crampel: better signal the right-of-way (or change it?), and make room for buses to turn left when exiting the square without being hindered by cars on the avenue coming from the left.
🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Such an arrangement would require the diversion of networks present on Russell Square and adapting the traffic plan.
Note that the maximum budget per project of €250,000 including taxes will not allow for a complete renovation of the square.
The project would also be subject to consultation with residents and neighborhood associations. It would also require formal approval from the Architecte des Bâtiments de France."
321;2024;Renovation of the bicycle path on Claude Gonin Street and towards the Cité de l'espace;The bike lanes on Claude Gonin Street and their continuation up to the Cité via Carosse Way exist but need at least a fresh coat of paint to be visible, and if possible, an improvement of the surface for the comfort of bicycles as well as scooters which have smaller wheels. These bike paths connect the Cité, Montaudran station, the heart of Gonin neighborhood, and the LIDL shopping center. They are heavily used. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The improvement of facilities for active modes on Gonin Street is among the issues addressed by the urban studies of the metro Sequence 5. While waiting for major developments that could occur in the medium term, the maintenance of the current bike lanes (repainting) is feasible.
235;2024;Urban Sport for Our Youth - Installation of a Skatepark;La Mounède, a green place, the central area of our neighborhoods with convenient bus service. Our young children and teenagers need nature, to come together to create real connections, to engage in sports, to excel. This natural site, currently unused, could host a space for the youth, a project that would surely span several years, and a participatory project could be a good start. A Pumptrack and/or skate park for tomorrow, our youth need it. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Very few offerings of this type in Toulouse, especially in the West. Consideration for placement at the Ramée leisure base due to the risk of noise nuisance for the residents. Study for an 800 m² skate park.
397;2024;Greening and tree planting on Léo Lagrange Street;"Greening and tree planting on Léo Lagrange Street to bring a breath of oxygen and natural coolness in summer, thus allowing for better air quality in a street that serves as a passageway and transition between neighborhoods. This will also beautify a street used by schoolchildren and high school students who are sensitive to this important issue for their future. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Due to the many networks present underground, the greening of Léo Lagrange Street is highly constrained. Planting a line of trees along the entire length of the street would exceed the financial envelope of the participatory budget. Therefore, it is proposed to remove the asphalt from all the parking spaces on the street, with the installation of grassed cellular paving. This would recreate soil porosity without losing any parking spaces. Additionally, trees could be planted sporadically if spaces free of networks and other constraints allow it. Furthermore, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green this street. However, the agreement of each owner is mandatory to green their front facade. The owner must also commit to maintaining the pits in the long term. Moreover, this initiative will be subject to technical feasibility conditions: absence of underground networks, absence of cellars or crawl spaces, and the need to maintain pedestrian continuity. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the city and metropolitan technical services, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

343;2024;Install cooling systems for the classrooms of St Simon schools.;The parents of students from the Guilhermy, Tibaous, and Paul Bert school groups propose the installation of cooling systems in the classrooms of these schools, such as air circulators/ceiling fans. Indeed, classroom temperatures can reach or even exceed 30°C during a heatwave, making the working conditions very difficult for both students and teachers. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of air circulators in the Guilhermy, Tibaous, and Paul Bert school groups to reduce classroom temperatures during periods of high heat.
322;2024;Stop the mosquito proliferation in Montaudran;The proliferation of mosquitoes is a real scourge on the quality of life for us in the Toulouse neighborhood! That's why I propose experimenting with planting, in the Montaudran area: gardens along the Ligne de la Piste des Géants up to the park near the EHPAD, with plants that would be effective in naturally keeping this pest away. Types of plants: citronella - lavender - mint - eucalyptus, etc. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PROVIDE: It is important to note that, to date, there is no scientific consensus on the effectiveness of such plants in repelling mosquitoes. Additionally, mosquito control stations will be installed in the neighborhood as part of the previous participatory budget. Therefore, egg-laying traps could also be considered as an addition in Montaudran.
363;2024;Greening of Fontaine Lestang metro station square and Henri Desbals street;Greening of the Fontaine Lestang metro square and Henri Desbals street, which are significant heat islands when it is hot. Bringing some greenery into these very mineral-heavy areas. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Greening of the Fontaine Lestang metro square and the intersection of Vestrepain and Desbals streets through the planting of greenery and the placement of flower containers.
345;2024;Extension of the greenway between Guilhermy and Lac de la Ramée;"Extend the development that allows cycling to Guilhermy College up to the Ramée base by reserving the currently furthest path from the small lake for pedestrians and cyclists. This could be done at a lower cost by widening the road closest to the lake between the bridge over the St Martory canal and the roundabout at the entrance to the base to make it 2 lanes for cars (the rest of the road is already wide enough). The crossing of the bridge would be done ""on sight."" WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Creation of a greenway in continuation of the existing greenway to create a junction between Guilhermy and Lake Ramée."
279;2024;Redevelopment of the Roland Garros dead-end for children;Roland-Garros Square is currently a heat island in the summer, and it suffers from significant noise pollution. Moreover, it lacks green spaces and facilities for children and their parents. Our idea for our neighborhood is to redevelop Roland Garros Square into a multisport field for children aged 10 and under, and to integrate it into a wooded, friendly, demineralized, and secure environment near the kindergarten. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Depending on additional soil studies specifically on the mineral slab, the installation of a playground complementing the existing playground could be considered: multi-use structures for ages 3 to 12 (slide, climbing games, swing, and spring games with a shade cover) + installation of a fountain + plantings. The cost estimate does not account for significant pollution cleanup or diversion of networks (stormwater and others...), €230,000, an additional €20,000 should be planned to redo the playground in the middle.
282;2024;Shared garden near the boules players at Croix Daurade;A plot of land has been abandoned next to the boules players' field. It is well situated for setting up a community garden as it is close to schools, the senior club, and the early childhood center. Ideal for intergenerational exchanges. It would bring freshness and conviviality and serve as an educational resource for the neighboring schools. A community compost bin would obviously find its place there. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: As part of the plan to create community gardens, the Croix Daurade neighborhood has no projects yet and we had identified it as a priority area given the proximity of facilities, schools, senior clubs, library... and a residential and collective housing conducive to diversity. However, a soil pollution study will be necessary to realize the idea.
380;2024;Bicycles/pedestrians/scooters cohabiting on the right bank of the Garonne Dike between Pont des Catalans and Ponts Jumeaux;On the dyke, at certain times, the coexistence of bicycles/pedestrians/scooters is difficult. One of the challenges is the excessive speed of some bicycles. The installation of an educational radar between the Pont des Catalans and the Ponts Jumeaux, accompanied by kindly worded communication signs for all users, would serve to remind everyone of the proper behaviors for sharing this beautiful space in a peaceful manner. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: For better cohabitation of the different users of the dyke between the Pont des Catalans and the Ponts Jumeaux, it is proposed to install an educational radar to raise awareness among cyclists. Additionally, a project is being studied within the community aimed at creating new markings, installing signage and furniture (barriers at the entrance of the dyke, totem signs, logos, and rough strips). If the results prove positive, this project could be deployed on this section of the dyke.
390;2024;Installation of an orientation table on Pont Neuf to identify the Pyrenean mountains;Hello, On a clear day, crossing the Pont Neuf, we have a magnificent view of the Pyrenees mountain range. I am frustrated by not being able to identify the peaks that appear. I think that many visitors to our city encounter the same frustration and would appreciate being able to be informed. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The type of equipment, their number, and their location will need to be studied.
232;2024;Enhancement and preservation of natural spaces in Sept Deniers;Preserve and enhance the natural spaces in the Sept Deniers by 1. protecting them (in the PLUIH) 2. naming and indicating them (signage for pedestrians and cyclists...) to make them known and accessible to everyone 3. making known the different species present in these parks (small educational panels at the foot of the trees) 4. respecting differentiated mowing to preserve biodiversity 5. preventing cars from parking there 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Differentiated mowing is applied city-wide as part of the policy for differentiated management of green spaces. Many areas are thus left with tall grasses and mowed late to respect biodiversity. Differentiated management also takes into account the challenges of usage (which must be respected and compatible with this management) and safety. In the Sept Deniers neighborhood, there are parks but also more scattered green spaces. The installation of dedicated panels to raise awareness among users about the presence of tall grasses, biodiversity, and also respect for plants and public space in general meets the needs. Cost: Graphic design involving an illustrator, manufacturing, and installation of several panels in green spaces - €50,000.
309;2024;Provide a safe crossing for pedestrians and bicycles on the bridges (exit no. 17);The crossing of the bridges over the ring road (exit no. 17) between Avenue de Castres and Balma is not safe for pedestrians and cyclists. The pedestrian crossings on both sides have high curbs on the sidewalks, making them difficult to access for people with reduced mobility. And for cyclists, there are no secure facilities. It would be interesting to redesign the pedestrian crossings and provide a bike lane to allow for the crossing of these bridges. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is interesting, especially for improving pedestrian pathways and accessibility for people with reduced mobility, but for cyclists, this will be studied within the framework of the express bike network project (REV 10), after a traffic study.
313;2024;Testing mosquito traps in the Château de l'Hers neighborhood;"Faced with the increasing number of mosquitoes in the neighborhood, I propose that the installation of mosquito traps on my street be experimented with. Traps such as ""ma boîte à moustiques"", Qista, etc., appear to be effective and are being trialed by communities. This experiment could involve willing residents of my street, and we could assess the effectiveness of these traps in conjunction with the services. This would allow the city council to decide later on whether or not to expand the use of these traps. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Principle agreement from the city’s animal sector. The type of equipment, their number, and their placement will be studied within the allotted timeframe for the realization of the idea, namely 2 years from the vote."
336;2024;"Implementation of ""shape detection"" lighting in Pech David, Rangueil, and Pouvourville";"As has already been done in some neighborhoods, public lighting could be turned off at night in the residential area of Pech David, Rangueil, and Pouvourville: less light pollution, energy savings, quality sleep for residents, benefits for the wildlife of a highly vegetated area and green lung of the urban area, and one could observe the stars from Pech David! 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is feasible by the services with the addition of the ""shape detection"" option, allowing the device to remain at 10% if no human shape is detected on the street, then to instantly switch to 100% upon detection."
250;2024;Drinking water fountain at the Place de la Charte des Libertés Communales;Installation of a drinking fountain in Place de la Charte des Libertés Communales. Drinking water is an essential need. Many children play in this area under the full sun. It seems important that this square be equipped with a fountain to enable proper hydration, to limit the consumption of sugary drinks, and the production of plastic (and therefore waste). Installation of a drinking fountain by tapping into one of the existing potable water networks. Approximately €5,000 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A more detailed study will be carried out by the competent municipal service.
271;2024;Tree Planting on Rue du Général Bourbaki;It would be possible to implement veganism at 96 rue du général Bourbaki and 95 rue du général Bourbaki. Several trees (3-4) could be planted without hindering vehicle parking and while bringing some freshness and shade in the summer. Similarly, tree plantings can be made between 119 and 110 Rue du Général Bourbaki. A large strip of land already has some trees/shrubs, but a real small forest could be established and enhance the neighborhood. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Possible planting of four trees on the roadway near 95 rue du Général Bourbaki, with roadwork to be planned (creation of pits on sidewalks and possible diversion of networks). The spaces in front of 96 and 119 rue du Général Bourbaki are private properties on which the community cannot intervene.
295;2024;Intersection of Boulevard d'Arcole and Rue de la Concorde;💡 THE IDEA EXPRESSED BY @PMaze: The crossing in front of Decathlon is not safe for bicycles coming down Rue de la Concorde and joining Jeanne d'Arc via either Boulevard or Rue de Merly opposite. One must use the pedestrian crossing or cross a white line. Moreover, it involves cycling against the direction on Concorde, moving to the left side so as not to hinder cars merging onto the service road or buses. Redesign of traffic lights, creation of a bicycle crossing🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A redesign of the intersection with road markings that include a dedicated space for cyclists can be implemented. Additionally, traffic lights for bicycles can be installed at various intersections, as well as a bicycle box for cyclists going from Place Jeanne d'Arc to Rue de la Concorde via the service road. This box will be located on the service road at the corner of Rue de la Concorde.
275;2024;Securing pedestrians and cyclists at the corner of Henri Bessemer Road and Chemin du Sang de Serp;At the intersection of Bessemer Road and Sang de Serp Road, there is no secure pedestrian crossing. Traffic is increasingly heavy on Sang de Serp Road and through the small adjacent streets (notably Bessemer Road) as drivers try to avoid the congested main roads. It has become very difficult and especially very dangerous to cross when one is a pedestrian or cyclist. Beyond proposing security measures, I am raising the alarm about the danger of this location for pedestrians and cyclists. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Possible security enhancement on a raised platform.
267;2024;Secure the bike passage between Rue de Metz and Pont Neuf;The new bike lane created on Rue de Metz finally allows for bike traffic on dedicated paths. One very dangerous point remains at the end of Rue de Metz, to cross Quai de Tounis towards Pont Neuf. Bikes coming from Rue de Metz cannot see cars turning left into Quai de Tounis from the same street. A separate bike traffic light, offset from the car lights, would be necessary for safe crossing for all users. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal as formulated cannot be accepted. Indeed, by regulation, the bike crossing is managed by the pedestrian light. As with all intersections with traffic lights, when the pedestrian light is green, vehicles in the left-turn lane also have a green light and must be vigilant for crossing bikes and pedestrians. Moreover, a three-color bike traffic light cannot be installed because this equipment requires a phase during which the bike light is on. This is not feasible due to the significant impact on traffic on Rue de Metz. However, an experiment can be set up on this pedestrian light with the installation of a bike crossing box: this will allow for a better understanding of the intersection by cyclists.
291;2024;Jean Jaurès Composting Site;"Establishment of a composting site on the Jean Jaurès ramblas in the middle and sheltered by the already existing vegetation (to avoid direct sunlight). The city hall could also use this compost as fertilizer for all the surrounding plants... But also collect the ""brown"" from the vegetation of these ramblas for composting. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Such an installation in this area can be studied. However, the conditions for technical feasibility do not seem optimal (hard soil, complex accessibility...). Finally, as with any collective composting site, a sufficient number of people committing to manage it will be necessary."
395;2024;Creation of a street art work in the neighborhood;The project involves beautifying the raw concrete walls of the neighborhood with street artists' works: Trémie Saint Agne, Pont de la voie ferrée Avenue Crampel, retaining walls of the Pont du Stadium. The idea is to install works that raise awareness about ecology (A-MO, Bordalo, Louis Masai Michel, ...). On a city scale, one could imagine the city of Toulouse proposing a bike discovery tour of Toulouse from the perspective of street art. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Creation of a mural on a large wall in one of the following neighborhoods: Saint-Agne, Saint-Michel, Le Busca, or Île du Ramier. The subject, as well as the location and scale of the work, will be more precisely defined by a commission composed of municipal elected officials and the artist(s) selected by the community for the realization. This project may also be subject to consultation with associations and/or residents of the neighborhood.
276;2024;Greening the front of Toulouse Lautrec Middle School;"Gaëlle: The entrance to the school consists of a few trees. Our idea is to make full use of the space, making it welcoming and friendly for both students and local residents:
- add some trees
- create flower beds and aromatic plant areas
- provide some benches
- install bicycle racks
- offer a dog waste bag dispenser.
This will help provide shade and coolness! 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It is possible to green this space on the northern part, with access for fire trucks and large vehicles on the southern part. The project would be to increase the number of trees by adding seven new ones on the sandy esplanade by creating new planting areas surrounded by low walls/seats and to create a slab with bicycle arches. No low-growing aromatic plants, only ground-cover plants at the base of the trees, due to recurring damage."
225;2024;Development of the Twin Bridges leisure base, creation of autonomous toilets;"The Twin Bridges Park is very popular for its basketball, soccer, and other sports fields, but there are no toilets or water points for hydration during physical activity (except for a small, inconspicuous tap at the tennis courts). Several water points should be created in the park. The accessibility for people with reduced mobility in the park also needs to be reviewed. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A water fountain will be installed in May 2024 (on Jean Gayral Street side), and the request for toilet installation has been approved; these will be autonomous toilets, and a specific location will need to be studied."
351;2024;Mosquito control actions in district 15;Mosquitoes are a public health hazard and prevent us from enjoying our outdoor spaces. Following the example set by the city council in the Compans-Amidonniers district, there is a request for the installation of oviposition traps in the Soupetard district as well as in all districts of Toulouse to combat the proliferation of tiger mosquitoes. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of mosquito traps on public buildings, in order to reduce their proliferation in the district.
273;2024;Redevelopment of the park at rue Fonquerne / rue Jean Nico;"The association Bien Vivre Chez Les Castors proposes to develop the park, which no longer meets current needs. Currently, the park is:
- Undersized
- A hazardous intersection due to a misunderstanding of the traffic flow
- Too sunny and unusable in summer

Proposal:
- Removal of a road replaced by a green space and a bike path
- Expansion of the area
- Improvement of a shaded, intergenerational community space

🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The redevelopment of the playground at the corner of Rue Fonquerne and Jean Nico is not straightforward, consultation with the residents is necessary as several options will be proposed. Changes to traffic flow, turning circles, and the possible rerouting of networks could exceed the budget of €250,000."
258;2024;City park for the young people of Ancely / Roman Arenas;Hello, the youth would need a city park in the Ancely Roman Arenas area. Thank you for considering this proposal. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Limited public land available for this project, needs further study. In June 2024, a Street workout will be installed at the Jardin des Arènes Romaines.
247;2024;Planting of fruit trees and/or berry bushes - Joséphine Baker Alley;Joséphine Baker Alley seems a bit neglected even though it appears to be increasingly frequented. I suggest planting fruit trees (apples, pears, plums, cherries, etc.) and/or berry bushes (mulberries, currants, raspberries, blueberries, etc.) and/or herbs (mint, basil, thyme, parsley, etc.) in this alley to reintroduce nature into the city and delight the food lovers! 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Planting in autumn after a more precise technical analysis of the soil.
324;2024;Bernard Maris Avenue Connection and Greenway between Aigle & CNES;"It would be wise to be able to connect directly by foot and by bicycle from Avenue Bernard Maris to the greenway between Rue Aigle & the Guillaumat roundabout (CNES, Airbus), passing west of the heating station. There are about 30 meters to develop. It is at the level of 5 Avenue Bernard Maris, Toulouse for one of the ends (location given by the map)🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It is an existing ""goat path"" between the alley of the Heating Station and the green canal path -Maris to be developed."
245;2024;Tree planting on the parking lot on Rue des Fontaines;Greening Rue des Fontaines to create a continuity of coolness between neighborhoods (Bourrasol-Casselardit). Plant trees in planting pits, impacting parking to create large pits with rainwater management. Drought-resistant species. Greening at the base of trees. De-impermeabilization of parking, taking advantage of the subsidy from the water agency. Show ambition in combating UHIs (urban heat islands)! 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Implementation to be studied as the road is constrained: narrow street and tall buildings. Prefer planters.
277;2024;Improvement of Parc de la Vache: Planting of trees and installation of additional tables and benches;Renovation of play areas, more greenery as well as additional tables and chairs. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The playground is in good condition. The ground was redone 2 years ago. The installation of additional benches and picnic tables could enhance the conviviality of this green space. Additional plantings would reinforce the greening and shading of the site. The proposal would therefore be to install 15 additional benches + 5 picnic tables adapted for people with reduced mobility and to plant about fifty trees to reinforce the existing alignments along the paths.
304;2024;Rehabilitate the Park on Charles Garnier Street - Soupetard neighborhood;Rehabilitating this park would transform this play area into a haven of sustainability and fun for the residents. Soupetard, a dynamic neighborhood in Toulouse, is home to many families for whom this space is a valuable source of recreation and relaxation. To meet the needs of the residents, it would be necessary to: clear the underbrush to prevent the proliferation of mosquitoes, convert the rubber ground into recycled materials, and replace the existing play structures. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Reinforcement is achievable through cleaning the play area and recharging the stabilized paths. Planting shrubs and perennial plants can also be considered to strengthen the existing vegetation.
269;2024;Soothe and greenify Rue de la Dalbade;"Hello, La rue de la Dalbade is very mineral-like, and the surroundings of the school are very dangerous because vehicles do not respect the speed limits on this street. By redesigning the front of the school with shrubs and a raised crossing, it would be possible to reduce vehicle speeds and calm this area. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Since January 2023, the Fabre nursery school has benefited from the 'school street' scheme on rue Saint-Jean. This scheme reduces traffic during school entry and exit times in front of the nursery school. An evaluation of the scheme is planned very soon with the parents of students and local residents. Depending on the feedback, additional modifications could be made. Regarding the security issues on rue de la Dalbade and around Fabre elementary school, a speed bump is already in place, and speed measurements are low. However, in addition to the existing speed bump, the deployment of a speed reduction scheme on the street can be proposed. The road markings could also be revised, particularly for pedestrian crossings near the school. A parking space will also be removed at the corner of Dalbade and St Jean for better visibility of the pedestrian crossing. Concerning the very mineral aspect of rue de la Dalbade, it can be proposed to ""green"" Pierre Brunière street (type of project with stemmed shrubs) where the sidewalk is wider than that of rue de la Dalbade (subject to the approval of the Architecte des Bâtiments de France and the absence of networks). Indeed, rue de la Dalbade is long, and such an arrangement is not compatible with the deadlines and budget associated with this participatory budget."
346;2024;Refurbishment and extension of the Gironis cycle path connecting the Lafourguette district to the Oncopole.;"This bike path is aging: Its surface, in poor condition, should be redone to better accommodate both cyclists and pedestrians. The temporary lighting installed in 2020 should be reevaluated with a focus on ""security – energy saving"": solar lighting and ground markings for better guidance of users. The path is interrupted starting from the Gironis/Chapitre roundabout: it needs to be extended to Maryse Bastié Street, passing in front of the Lafourguette community hall. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Development of a continuous and regulatory greenway between Gironis Street and Chapitre Road, passing by the Lafourguette community hall. This operation includes modifying the existing surfaces and securing the crossings."
246;2024;Rehabilitation of the Barry Garden boulodrome;As part of the various projects undertaken by the city hall in the Barry garden, we would like the boulodrome located in this garden to be rehabilitated. Its management could then be entrusted to a boulistes association from the neighborhood. This project would complete the renovation of the Barry garden and would bring together all pétanque enthusiasts from the neighborhood and beyond, regardless of their origin and age. It would also bring life to the upper part of the garden. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Finalize the rehabilitation of the sports facilities in the Barry garden. In connection with the development of access to the garden by the TOEC.
361;2024;Greening of Emile Male Square;"To better cope with the heat, greening Place Émile Male would aid the Friday merchants. Among other things, greening is really necessary on Rue de Cugnaux and Nungesser et Coli; these are the only two streets without trees and greenery. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Creation of significant shade in the heart of Place Emile Male through climbing plants growing on a trellis, creating a green veil above the square. Preservation of comfortable peripheral circulation for vehicles on market days."
327;2024;Underground safety in Montaudran for pedestrians and cyclists;The underground area of Montaudran station is shared between bicycles and pedestrians, but without any demarcation of spaces. The turn between the two ramps of the underpass is dangerous because pedestrians and bicycles cannot see each other. It would be necessary to demarcate a bicycle lane along the underpass and install a mirror at the curve just before the stairs. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The installation of a mirror is not permissible under current regulations, however, given the increase in pedestrian traffic linked to the metro and the busy days at the Halle des Machines, the demarcation of a bicycle lane should be considered, provided there is enough width to create both a sidewalk and a bicycle path (a total minimum of 4.5m), as well as encouraging able-bodied pedestrians to use the stairs to avoid conflicts of use.
359;2024;Securing the bike lane on Henri Desbals Street;The one-way system has reduced the number of vehicles using the road. However, cars still drive too fast, some even use the bike lane for overtaking or parking. Therefore, it is necessary to secure this street with bollards between the two lanes (bike and car) and consider installing speed bumps. The current red speed bumps are useless. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of extruded curbs to separate the bike lane from the roadway. Visual reinforcement of the layout with a colored coating and installation of speed cushions.
357;2024;Redevelop the greenway between Fontaine Lestang Park and the Arènes;Objective: To give this greenway its own identity throughout, making it enjoyable to travel by bike and conducive to relaxation and stops when traveled on foot. This could be achieved by artistically designing the walls along it, widening the usable space by paving grassy shoulders (pavers with joints that allow for rainwater infiltration), and enhancing the greenery to make it more verdant and attractive. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Establishing a unique identity through ground markings that bring unity to the path while enlivening it. De-impermeabilization of the existing widened areas.
236;2024;Promoting cool islands in Lardenne through greening;Promote cool spots in Lardenne by introducing vegetation. Accompany it with composting sites as well as vegetable gardens. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Identify possible sites and, depending on technical constraints, plant trees or shrubs in Lardenne.
223;2024;Reinstall public toilets near Job square;Public toilets no longer exist in the Sept Deniers neighborhood. Those that were between Place JOB and the garden of the toy library have disappeared for several years. They were used among other times on Sunday morning during the open-air market by the public and the merchants who, when the swimming pool is closed, have no other solution! 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The installation of a Decaux sanisette is possible near Place Job.
331;2024;Greening Lauragais Avenue;From 48 to 106 Lauragais Avenue (railway) there is a wide road, thus the possibility of planting trees on at least one side to cool down this heat island (street). The cables would need to be buried first. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is acceptable provided that the congestion of the underground can be verified, which is currently underway. In the short term, it is possible to plant trees by removing some parking spaces.
270;2024;Installation of wooden planters at the Claude Nougaro metro station;A row of hackberry trees cools the Minimes Avenue. However, due to the metro access construction, this row has been interrupted over a significant length. As a result, it gets very hot there in the summer. My idea would be to restore the alignment and place a shade structure where it's not possible (the restaurant terraces would be more attractive). It would also be a good opportunity to regulate the trash bins, as this area is overrun with them all day Sunday. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Planting trees is impossible over a metro corridor. There is a possibility to be validated by Tisséo, using artificial planters without the possibility of connecting to the natural ground is feasible (about 15 m long).
239;2024;Mosquito trap in Lardenne;There might be a mosquito trap at the start of the greenway on the Barigoude path racket (regular presence of stagnant water in the ditch), which is a meeting point for the start of jogging or bike rides. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The type of equipment, their number, and their placement must be studied.
229;2024;Stop mosquitoes, let's switch to traps in the Lalande district;Mosquitoes are a public health hazard and prevent us from enjoying our outdoor spaces. Installation of oviposition traps in the LALANDE neighborhood to combat tiger mosquitoes. The oviposition traps stop the proliferation (egg-laying) and capture tiger mosquitoes. Specific to this species, this solution targets a key and essential stage in the life cycle of the tiger mosquito. Let's try to enjoy our gardens and our beautiful pink city. Thank you all. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Principle agreement from the city's animal sector. The type of equipment, their number, and their locations will be studied within the allotted time frame for the realization of the idea, namely 2 years from the vote. Preferred sites are public facilities (schools, nurseries, parks) which are rather enclosed as the devices (traps) are often stolen or damaged.
252;2024;Secure and greenify Casselardit Avenue;Between numbers 55 and 105 on Casselardit Avenue, the speed of cars is excessive with narrow sidewalks. This makes the odd-numbered side of the avenue dangerous for pedestrians and residents wishing to leave their homes. Crossing the avenue is also complicated with few pedestrian crossings. Additionally, adding vegetation along the bike path would make it more pleasant during heatwaves. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: To study the securing of avenue crossings and the limitation of speed on this axis. It should be noted that lanes used by buses are subject to specific standards (speed bumps, etc.).
350;2024;Greening the bases of the lime trees on Avenue de Muret;I propose removing the asphalt around ALL the trees on Muret Avenue, not just 4 trees. With the removal of the bike lane on the opposite side, there is room to green this avenue, which really needs it! 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Removal of the asphalt at the base of the lime trees on Muret Avenue and planting of vegetation to enhance the aesthetics of the road and reduce mineralized surfaces.
286;2024;Redevelopment of the courtyard of the Borderouge nursery school;"The greening of schoolyards (""oasis courtyards"") has widely demonstrated its benefits for our children: adapting our infrastructure to climate warming and the now inevitable heatwaves, as well as familiarizing our children with nature. We therefore request the creation of an oasis courtyard at the Borderouge preschool, which is particularly concreted. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The Toulouse City Hall has launched a program to develop schoolyards to meet the challenges of cooling, but also inclusion and diversity in these spaces for play and learning. This program is planned with regard to multi-criteria priorities, taking into account factors such as shade, soil, etc. The courtyard of the Borderouge preschool has not been classified among the highest priority given its recent redevelopment. If this idea were accepted, this schoolyard could potentially benefit from new plantings and the installation of a play area in the existing soil spaces."
243;2024;Self-service bicycle pumps;In the La Cartoucherie neighborhood, La Grande Halle is highly visited. Soft connections being favored for travel, many bicycles are parked around the area. However, it sometimes happens that a tire needs to be inflated before leaving. Why not install fixed bicycle pumps among the most used bike racks? It will always be possible to extend this idea to other neighborhoods in the city and further facilitate this mode of transport. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: To be studied to determine the installation sites as part of a specific purchase. Between 1 to 3 stations. On an experimental basis.
379;2024;Improve sidewalk lighting on the alleys of Barcelona between Héraclès and Ponts-Jumeaux;Improve the lighting of the pedestrian sidewalk between Place Héraclès and Ponts-Jumeaux to see where one is walking/what one is stepping on as soon as night falls. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: On the allées de Barcelone, for the section located between Place Héracles and Ponts-Jumeaux, it is proposed to install a new lighting network on the residential side, which includes the supply and installation of about 20 lighting poles (with an underground network).
389;2024;Create toilets for the Column and Observatory gardens;The Column and Observatory gardens house children's play areas and host occasional events (open-air cinema, etc.), attracting a diverse audience. In summer, locals also visit to enjoy some coolness. However, neither the two parks nor the neighborhood provide restrooms, which causes inconvenience for users and discourages their attendance. It would be beneficial to install public toilets in close proximity to these two parks to enhance user comfort. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It is conceivable to create public toilets near these gardens. However, the Column and Observatory gardens are listed as Historical Monuments. Similarly, the fence, garden, and stable are registered as historical monuments. Should the vote be successful, a file after studies should therefore be submitted to the DRAC (Ministry of Culture) at the time of applying for the Building Permit. Additionally, work to connect to various underground networks will need to be carried out.
384;2024;A widened sidewalk on Allée Serge Ravanel, near the Jardin des Plantes;Serge Ravenel Alley, the sidewalk along the Jardin des Plantes and to the left of the Capitole gate has been widened and paved with permeable joints. I wish that the sidewalk to the right of the Capitole gate, which is very narrow, be widened (by removing parking) and redone with paving stones and permeable joints, thus a bike lane will also be created. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: This request has been accepted. The sidewalk on the north side of Serge Ravanel Alleys, next to the Jardin des Plantes, can be widened and paved, continuing the arrangement made in 2023. Similarly, a cycling lane can also be marked up to the Grand Rond. This arrangement would remove about 30 existing parking spaces.
392;2024;More bike racks at the Cabanis Library;There are already several bike racks near the Cabanis library, but they are very insufficient, and people are forced to lock their bikes to the library barriers, trash cans, etc., and they are everywhere. Adding a large bike rack, the size of the 2 pre-existing ones, would be very useful! 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal to implement bike parking around the Cabanis media library has been accepted. Bike racks in continuation of those existing on Rue René Leduc will be installed. Moreover, as part of the ongoing study for the installation of street furniture in Marengo Square, which aims to harmonize the urban furniture in the square, additional bike supports could be installed, subject to technical constraints and the opinion of the ABF.
344;2024;Install a bike shelter at the entrance of Paul Bert Elementary School;"Paul Bert Elementary School has several bike racks inside the school at the entrance; however, these racks are not sheltered. The inability to protect bikes and scooters from the elements is a deterrent to using these modes of transportation in bad weather. Facilitating and making the use of sustainable transport options more practical will undoubtedly help reduce the severe traffic congestion in front of the school in the mornings, especially on rainy days. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of a bike shelter at the entrance of Paul Bert School to protect the children's bikes in case of bad weather."
319;2024;Garden birdhouses;I suggest that birdhouses for garden birds be placed in the trees of the Terrasse neighborhood, for example at the Parc de la Plaine, Jardin Corraze, and Espace Vert Trutat. This will promote animal biodiversity. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Principle agreement from the city's animal department. The type of equipment, their number, and their locations will be studied within the allotted time frame for the realization of the idea, namely 2 years from the vote.
301;2024;Follow the bike path all along the Gabardie road.;Creation of a bicycle path between Atlanta Boulevard and the end of Paule Raymondis Street, where many cyclists are knocked over. The path goes from Gramont to the start of the industrial zone which has been completely forgotten. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: In the absence of public transport serving the area and to ensure the continuity of developments on Vasseur and Gabardie, a cycling facility on Paule Raymondis Street is necessary for modal shift. However, it must be accompanied by measures to discourage speeding.
391;2024;Greening and de-asphalting of Compans Street;"Depaving and greening of Compans Street as in the 3 Pillars Street at Arnaud Bernard. The objectives are both ecological and aesthetic:
- Combat the intensifying heatwaves
- Reduce flooding by better absorbing excess water
- Increase biodiversity
- Add more greenery and color to the avenue
🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The section between Marengo Boulevard and Colonne Avenue has been recently redeveloped. Moreover, a gas pipeline is buried under the sidewalk on the residential side, meaning that the project would be over budget considering the costs of diverting networks. Additionally, no planting can be carried out on the railway side. The section between Colonne Avenue and Cimetière Avenue, however, can be greened in line with the odd-numbered parking spaces, as the gas network runs on the other side of the street. Such a project would eliminate about 14 parking spaces."
312;2024;Make the Place de la Cité de l'Hers more welcoming, in summer and winter, with a canopy for the heart of the Château de l'Hers neighborhood.;"The square designed as the heart of the Hers district in front of the shops at the ""rotonde / le champignon"" is very stony, and the 6 trees planted will only provide shade in a few years. I propose the installation of a shade structure on this square to make it more pleasant on sunny days. This shade structure would meet the challenges of a cooler Toulouse. Its installation must be compatible with the organization of the weekly market. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea of a shade structure is acceptable, either planted or weighted depending on the square's surface, and its shape could be in harmony with the rest of the development. Additional trees could also be planted. Regarding lighting: recent devices less than 10 years old, LED, and a lighter surface coating for beautiful luminescence already exist."
317;2024;Replant Sacarin Garden;Replant trees, groves, and shrubs in Sacarin garden to improve its currently rather shabby state. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Sacarin park is a well-vegetated park but suffers from an overall aging condition (furniture, paths, fences, etc.). Beyond new plantings, the goal is to move towards a renovation of this park.
328;2024;Terrace Road: promoting cohabitation between motorized vehicles and cyclists;"Removing the central reservation and adding bike lanes would be counterproductive: the speed of motor vehicles would increase due to the wider roadways. This road would become a ""Gonin Avenue"" / ""Védrines Street"" / ""Didier Daurat Avenue"" ""bis"". Proposal: draw bike chevrons in the center of the roadway to legitimize cyclists and use some extra widths to allow motor vehicles to overtake. Reference: https://velobs.2p2r.org/index.php?id=812🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Adding bike logos and double chevrons not in the center of the street but at 1.50m from the sidewalk edge remains possible."
334;2024;Installation of benches in the Sauzelong neighborhood;In the context of consultations with CDCH and for the Heart of the District, a glaring lack of urban furniture for resting was noted in the Sauzelong neighborhood. The area is inhabited by many elderly people and by persons with reduced mobility, who are the first to suffer from this shortfall. The urgent request is the installation of this type of furniture on Av A. Bedouce and the addition of one or two benches on the greenway between the Pont des Demoiselles and the roundabout at bd de la Marne-Av A. Bedouce. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is consistent with the needs and uses.
364;2024;Renovate the Gabriel Koenings underpass;"Renovate the underpass on Boulevard Gabriel Kœnigs, which is frequently used by pedestrians and cyclists. This underpass is ""visually"" dirty and poorly maintained, and also olfactorily, as it is used as a urinal. The renovation would involve: - Refurbishing the walls and floors with bright colors or murals; using waterproof paints and materials - Changing the lighting to LEDs and something very bright - Reviewing the water (and urine) drainage systems 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Cleaning the underpass under the railway and creating a mural by an artist on the walls and ceiling of the tunnel."
272;2024;Landscaping/floral/greening - corner of Bessemer road and Jean Philippe Rameau street;Intersection of JP Rameau Street and Bessemer Way, city-owned parcel: a glass recycling bin for illegal dumping, and large, recent electrical cabinets. Is it possible to beautify this piece of land? For example: real trees, flowers, artwork? Objectives: to enhance the living environment (as in the city center), reduce illegal dumping, contribute to biodiversity, combat global warming, and consider the interests of the suburban residents as well as those in the center. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The project requires roadwork and the implementation of safety measures at the intersection to be integrated into the greening of the space.
296;2024;Installation of plant structures on Rue de l'Orient;"Every day, families walk along the streets of l'Orient and Saint-Orens to take their children to school. These streets need to be calmed and closed to traffic. Access to private parking must be preserved. Replace parking spaces with planters, children's play areas, street furniture, and dog parks. Install manual barriers for security. Create opportunities to use the space for flea markets, festivals, meals, and entertainment. Create a pedestrian and bicycle path. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Pedestrianizing the axis from rue de l'Orient to Saint Orens cannot be considered under this scheme. Indeed, this axis is very long and such a proposal would require a comprehensive review of the traffic plan and a study of an arrangement that integrates the updating of public spaces in terms of accessibility, soft mobility, etc. Such a project is not compatible with the deadlines and costs associated with this participatory budget. However, a consultation must be initiated before the end of the year as part of the redevelopment project of Place Jeanne d'Arc: this axis should be included in the study perimeter. Nevertheless, a specific arrangement on the only section of the widened sidewalk (opposite the impasse de l'Orient) with the possible removal of 2 parking spaces (corner of rue Raymond IV) could be carried out with the installation of ""vegetal structures"" that would enhance and cool the street. This project will be feasible subject to compatibility with existing networks and prior approval from the ABF."
402;2024;Planting an orchard at the Clémence Isaure Garden;Clémence Isaure Garden has a grassy area (opposite 133 rue des Arcs Saint-Cyprien) that is little frequented. If the soil permits, it could be a beautiful spot for planting fruit trees and shrubs, with harvests spread throughout the season (apricots, apples, pears, hazelnuts, raspberries, currants). In addition to providing small pickings for the residents of the neighborhood and the students of the adjoining college, this urban orchard would allow for a better understanding of the seasonality of harvests. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It is possible to plant fruit trees at the back of Clémence Isaure square, provided that a study on soil pollution is negative. The available space being very limited in the square, the possibility of planting trees will presumably be limited to 5 fruit trees.
405;2024;Refurbishment of the existing ramp for access to the Garonne dike (av. de Muret) from the parking area below the Fer à Cheval.;Access to the dike via the dead-end at the washhouse can only be achieved by a staircase, which is inconvenient for pedestrians and unsuitable for bicycles. Transforming this dead-end into a passage for bicycles and pedestrians would allow easy access to the dike from Avenue de Muret. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: An improvement of the access from the parking area below the Fer à Cheval to the top of the dike is proposed (ground refurbishment, signposting, replacement of concrete walls...), subject to technical feasibility. Regulatory and technical reasons do not allow for the construction of a ramp on the dead-end of the Lavoir. Indeed, any development project must be accessible to people with reduced mobility. Therefore, if a ramp for pedestrians and bicycles were to be constructed at the end of the dead-end, it would have to comply with regulatory standards of a 4% slope with a resting platform every 10 meters. Here, there is about 2 meters between the level of the dead-end and the level of the dike. This would require a development of at least 50 linear meters, which is not feasible given the depth (about 6 meters) of the space at the end of the dead-end.
278;2024;Installation of a traffic light at the crossing at the intersection of Chemin du Sang-de-Serp and Boulevard de l'Embouchure.;The high speed of vehicles along the Canal du Midi axis makes the use of pedestrian crossings without lights impossible. This is particularly the case for the one located under the Haedens footbridge: we therefore propose to install a push-button activated traffic light at this location. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: There is a study available that allows for the upgrading of the bus stop, the installation of a traffic light, and the securing of the pedestrian crossing, with the estimated cost of the works exceeding the budget of €250,000 per idea within the framework of the Participatory Budget regulation. Moreover, the Grand Parc Canal project may impact this route. It seems more prudent to wait to have a clear view of the planned developments. In compensation, the Sang de Serp intersection is equipped with ducting, allowing for the activation of a traffic light and the necessary additional arrangement for the cycle path at this location.
224;2024;Secure bicycle parking at Place Job;All the bike parking at the JOB pool are wheel clamps: convert these parking spaces to secure hoops (children and adults) - note this building is managed by the DASC (Social and Cultural Affairs) 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It is possible to install more secure bike racks at the staircase of the Espace Job.
285;2024;Mosquito Control in Paléficat;In line with what is being done by the city hall in the Compans-Amidonniers district, there is a request for the installation of oviposition traps in the Paléficat district to combat the proliferation of tiger mosquitoes. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Principle agreement from the city's animal sector. The type of equipment, their number, and their locations will be studied within the allotted time frame for the realization of the idea, namely 2 years from the vote. Preferred sites are public facilities (schools, nurseries, parks) which are more enclosed as the devices (traps) are often stolen or damaged.
373;2024;Create shade and green the forecourt of the Grand M media library;It would be good to plant more plants on this large square, which becomes unbearable in the summer due to the heat. We could even put up canopies with benches underneath to allow for reading in the shade. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of furniture and plants on the square in front of the media library to create shade and provide coolness.
393;2024;Greening and de-asphalting of Cemetery Avenue;"Depaving under certain trees on Cemetery Avenue (those without parking spaces, bike racks, or electric charging stations). As in front of 24 Cemetery Avenue and Rue des 3 Piliers at Arnaud Bernard. The goals are both ecological and aesthetic:
Reduce flooding by allowing better absorption of excess water, which will benefit the trees
Improve soil quality for the trees
Increase biodiversity
Add more greenery and color to the avenue
🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Cemetery Avenue could be depaved in two types of areas (75 diagonal parking spaces and spaces between tree bases). Initially, the project could extend from Saint Paul Street to the cemetery parking lot. Then, in a second phase (outside the participatory budget), on the parking lot directly in front of the cemetery entrance. The project would involve removing the existing pavement between the tree bases and replacing it with grassed concrete slabs that allow for vehicle parking. This would reduce the amount of paved surface while still maintaining on-street parking availability. Such a project would need to be reviewed by SDIS 31 to ensure compatibility with fire service access to buildings. Finally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green these streets. Facades, for example, can be greened at the owner's request, with support from the community. The owner must also commit to maintaining the planters in the long term. This initiative will be subject to technical feasibility conditions: no underground networks, no basements or crawl spaces, and pedestrian continuity must be maintained. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the city and metropolitan technical services once residents submit their requests via the online form available on the community's website.

231;2024;Installation of a street workout module in the future Dortis Park;Parkour, accessible to all, promotes mobility, creativity, and physical strengthening. A dedicated area would support an active lifestyle, enhancing social cohesion and attracting new practitioners. It would satisfy enthusiasts while diversifying the sports activities in Toulouse, contributing to the community's flourishing. The area would invigorate our public spaces, creating a gathering place for all ages and strengthening urban identity by fostering exchange. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The available lands that will be freed from the temporary structure of the old school on Dortis road will host a public garden by 2026, a city stadium, and a gymnasium in 2027. There will not be enough space available to create a parkour area, it is proposed to complement the future facilities by installing a street workout module.
314;2024;Action for the removal of the illegal dump at Jean Chaubet by planting vegetation;At the corner of Rue Monié and Avenue Jean Chaubet, a small bitumen triangle of a few square meters has been used as an illegal dump for over 30 years. Why has the city council never addressed this known public hygiene issue? To deter polluters, it would be necessary to decontaminate the soil to allow grass and some plants to grow, and also to install anti-car bollards to prevent vehicles from accessing the site, from which washing machines, sofas, and other trash bags are unloaded at night. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It seems indeed that there are few voluntary drop-off points (PAV) in the neighborhood because few locations are suitable for the dimensions of the PAVs: the idea is acceptable. Depending on the site and soil constraints, count €4000 per planting pit and tree. These plantings could be complemented by ground-cover plants at the base of trees and shrubs.
292;2024;Mark the pedestrian crossings and slow down traffic on Gabriel Péri and d'Aubuisson streets.;💡 THE IDEA EXPRESSED BY @MikaTlse: First on Gabriel Péri street, then Riquet, Aubuisson, and wherever the speed is too high. The targeted vehicles are cars but also two-wheelers! It would be necessary to install speed bumps with a gentler slope across the entire length of the crossing (to prevent two-wheelers from swerving to avoid them). Do this primarily for major roads: to slow down traffic, for pedestrian safety, and for vehicles that are victims of right-of-way violations. Adjust the number based on cost. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Arrangements can be proposed on Gabriel Péri and Aubuisson streets, as Riquet street has just been completely redesigned with the integration of devices that encourage speed reduction. Speed bumps/Berlin cushions could be installed on these two streets near pedestrian crossings and intersections, to reduce vehicle speed. However, prior road counts must be carried out to confirm this issue.
316;2024;Remove the asphalt from the TUC Rugby parking lot;"The parking area of the TUC Rugby facilities on Rue C Rougenet is fully paved. In the era of climate change and the fight against heat islands, I propose that the parking be depaved to eliminate an impermeable surface (about 3000 m²) and ""break up"" a heat island. To accommodate the parking usage, it could be fitted with solutions like evergreen slabs. If the cost exceeds €250k, 2 phases could be considered. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Since the parking belongs to the city of Toulouse, it is possible to depave it."
383;2024;Installing public toilets in the public garden of Pays d'Oc;The public garden in the Pays d'Oc (between François Longaud Street and Gallois Street) is very popular, especially with families, but there are no public toilets. It would be advisable to install some, such as composting toilets similar to those implemented at the Argoulets. These public toilets could be located, for example, near the entrance opposite Henri Tagnères Street (towards the transformer) or alternatively near the entrance on Gallois Street, slightly shifting the dog park. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The installation of a public restroom in the Pays d'Oc garden is not subject to any particular heritage-related approvals. However, the feasibility of such an installation remains subject to the compatibility with the underground networks of the street, to which the restroom would need to be connected.
339;2024;Greening Rue de Gironis;The bike path on Rue de Gironis, between the Médipole clinic and the A64 tunnel, has no shade. Would it be possible to plant trees that could provide shelter for walkers and cyclists on sunny days? 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Planting trees and greening the spaces between parking spots on Rue de Gironis.
329;2024;Requalification and Greening of the Ducuing/Salade Ponsan/Vallon/Pouvourville Intersection;This intersection is unnecessarily very wide, difficult to cross on foot and by bike, with many wasted spaces and fully paved central strips. I propose to reduce its size to a simple crossroads, without slip roads, and to depave and green all the reclaimed space. It would be a beautiful gateway to Pech David and the future Larrey OAP. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: After checking the underground congestion, this idea is feasible along with the planting of trees.
241;2024;Basketball / Volleyball / Soccer Field in Lardenne;We know that music and sports are areas that contribute to the social well-being of young people. However, most activities in cultural centers require payment for annual participation. It would be great to also have free access to team sports in more neighborhoods (Lardenne, Minimes, etc.) similar to the stadium (where there is basketball, soccer, running, beach volleyball, tennis). Several spaces are abandoned. For example, there is no free basketball court in Lardenne. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: To complement the neighborhood's offerings in the Lardenne sector. Notably with the project to open the garden of the petit Capitole where there are already soccer/handball goals and a basketball hoop: an offer to be expanded.
377;2024;Greening of Lejeune and Lancefoc Streets;"Hello, Like Embarthe Street, with our neighborhood association BALLH, we would like Lejeunes and Lancefoc streets to be greened in order to bring some coolness during the heatwave, greenery to be less concrete, to attract more biodiversity, to remove this excess of asphalt, to give a countryside look, etc... 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Generally, many networks are present in Lejeune and Lancefoc streets. Also, a greening project on these streets would require the prior diversion of networks, an operation incompatible with the deadlines and costs associated with this participatory budget. However, a redevelopment of the Lejeune / Lancefoc intersection aimed at reducing the lanes dedicated to traffic, by widening pedestrian public spaces, with a view to making plantings, is feasible. Finally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green this street. This initiative, after agreement from the concerned owners, is subject to technical feasibility conditions: no underground networks, no cellars or crawl spaces, pedestrian continuity to be respected. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the technical services of the city hall and the metropolis, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform. More information at: https://metropole.toulouse.fr/actualites/des-fleurs-sur-mon-mur"
375;2024;Improving the space for toddlers at the Compans Caffarelli garden;Installing toddler-friendly garden furniture in the Compans garden, similar to that in the gymnasium garden at Place St Sernin🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Modeled after the furniture installed in the garden on rue Cartailhac (small table with wooden log seats, all made of robinia): it is possible to install 3 such setups in the Compans garden. These seats allow the little ones with their parents to play board games, draw... they would complement the other existing modules.
255;2024;Greening near the Roman amphitheater;Displaying the area between the entrance of the amphitheater and Casselardit Avenue. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Integrated into the 2 ongoing projects: the opening of the Roman Arenas and the redevelopment of the Saint-Martin neighborhood house. Opening of the Ducis park garden. Planting of about forty trees.
325;2024;Tree Densification in the Bois de Ribaute;The educational forest of Ribaute covers an area of 32 hectares, and 537 trees and shrubs have been planted there. From a forestry perspective, as a green lung and the creation of green spaces for the future 20,000 inhabitants of the Malepère Marcaissone district, this is a start but clearly insufficient. With an average density of 800 trees per hectare, at least 25,000 more trees are needed. At an average cost of €4,000 per hectare, this would amount to €128,000. We would see the results in 20-30 years. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Given the budget, it is possible to plant an additional 300 trees in the Ribaute forest. The site will be secured beforehand.
366;2024;Mosquito trap in Bagatelle;It would be necessary to install a mosquito trap in the Bagatelle area near Parc 2. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of mosquito traps on public buildings, in order to reduce their proliferation in the neighborhood.
352;2024;Securing and coloring of the crosswalk on Avenue de Muret - Maurice Becanne Kindergarten;The crosswalk across Muret Avenue leading to the Maurice Becanne kindergarten on Impasse Butinon is used by many children and parents. It is also barely visible to cars, scooters, bicycles, and scooters. The risk of being run over is recurrent. A friendly and colorful layout could both appeal to children and alert road users to the crossing (for example, with a speed bump and coloring around the lights). 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Improve the visibility of the pedestrian crossing in front of the Maurice Becanne school to ensure the safety of families going to the school.
283;2024;Lighting of the Railway Tunnel connecting Vitry cul-de-sac to Barthe cul-de-sac;From Vitry dead-end to Barthe dead-end, one passes through a narrow, dimly lit railway tunnel that is very distressing. However, it is the shortest route to walk from 3-cocus to Minimes, or to the Lautrec Pool. To better illuminate it, I propose repainting the walls a light color, installing more effective lighting, possibly adjustable with a motion detector. And to install two emergency call stations in case of an unpleasant encounter or incident. Thank you. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The City Hall can repair the tunnel's spotlights, however, there are issues of incivility that make maintaining the system difficult.
337;2024;Creation of a cycling signage between Basso Cambo and Guilhermy;"Due to the protective mounds, cyclists coming from Guilhermy along the dedicated bike path and wanting to go towards Basso Cambo do not always see the connection that passes under the large roundabout; there is a lack of signage at this location, and at the exit on the Mounède side. The same is true after crossing Saint Simon road; there are cyclists who cross Eisenhower because they have not seen the underpass, again due to a lack of signage. Ground markings need to be made. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of directional signs at the intersections of bike paths to identify existing bike path continuities."
349;2024;Greening of the central reservations on the Route d'Espagne;On the road to Spain, between the September 21 roundabout and the peripheral bridge, it would be advisable to remove the central median where there is no car crossing. Instead, given the width, a multitude of plants could be planted to cool down this street. This could be done in partnership with the children from the Oustalous school to raise their awareness of ecology. It would help to de-impermeabilize a good portion of the street and also prevent illegal parking. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Removal of asphalt and planting of vegetation on the central medians of the road to Spain in order to reduce the heat of this axis in summer.
293;2024;Installation of bike racks in the Chalets district;"In the Chalets district, as well as throughout Toulouse, more and more bicycles are being parked on the streets in a very anarchic manner. The increasing use of bicycles only amplifies this phenomenon. Proposal: install bicycle parking in the streets in place of one or more car parking spaces. These exist but are very few. Consider other means of parking bicycles. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: To avoid the anarchic parking of bicycles in the Chalets district, the community proposes the installation of urban furniture such as bicycle racks. These installations can be carried out on car parking spaces of a single spot: this parking must be protected or ""integrated"" for safety and protection of cyclists. In this district, most streets have unprotected parking and narrow sidewalks that do not allow the addition of bicycle supports. However, Rue de la Balance (at the right of No. 40 on a 2-car parking space) and Rue des Chalets (about 7 vehicle spaces protected by curbs) could accommodate bicycle racks. If this idea were adopted, 9 vehicle parking spaces would be removed on these 2 streets."
387;2024;Pedestrian network stroll;"Within district 4.1, identify (through dedicated signage, recognizable from a distance and notable) the main points of interest in the district and suggest walking tours (e.g., ""green walk,"" ""heritage walk,"" ""sports walk,"" etc.). Objective: to enhance the district - marking of safe routes - identification and communication on the main services and places. Streets involved: to be defined during a workshop. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The type of signage, the number of panels, and their locations will need to be studied. However, the proposal to create urban walks cannot be funded by the participatory budget, as it is primarily an operating expense."
348;2024;An Artwork at Croix de Pierre;Croix de Pierre Square (which will soon be renovated) could host a large piece of art, even better if accessible to children, that highlights the connection of this square with the Garonne, its role as a former gateway to the city, now a gateway to the stadium, and the center of the neighborhood. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of a piece of art at Croix-de-Pierre.
227;2024;Installation of exercise equipment for muscle strengthening at Parc des Sept Deniers;This park is rather underappreciated, even being transformed into a parking lot when there are matches at Stade Toulousain. It would be interesting to enhance its value to improve the living environment of the neighborhood in anticipation of its upcoming densification with the arrival of line C. For example, it would be interesting to take advantage of the available space to plant new trees and/or install a street workout type sports facility. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A section of the park will be developed to install a playground with a zip line as well as a city stadium. In order to avoid overloading with equipment and to maintain a natural space aspect, it is proposed to additionally install 4 muscle strengthening apparatuses: dip bars, pull-up bar, wall bars, and a ladder.
268;2024;Access control at the entrance of Rue Cujas;With travel already heavily restricted in the city center, the streets around the Place de la Bourse deserve to be pedestrianized. I am referring to the streets of Sainte Ursule, Bourse, Clémence Isaure, Cujas, and Prieuré. These streets, not renovated for too long, only serve as diversion routes, or to access other streets that are already closed. My proposal: control at the entrances of all these streets with bollards. The benefits: less noise, less pollution, less risk of accidents... 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The installation of barriers at the entrance of each of these streets cannot be considered within the framework of this call for ideas (due to budget and associated implementation timelines). Indeed, the implementation of automated access controls on all these roads requires the initiation of in-depth studies that cannot be carried out over the dedicated period. Moreover, the streets of Saint Ursule, Clémence Isaure, Cujas, and Prieuré deserve a comprehensive reflection in terms of planning, following the one carried out on Rue Gambetta. However, the installation of access control at the entrance of Rue Cujas can be considered within the framework of this call for ideas and initially, the buildings on this street do not have vehicle access. Such a project must nevertheless be submitted for the opinion of the Architecte des Bâtiments de France and subject to technical feasibility related to the presence of necessary networks. Additionally, it should be noted that a school street project is being studied for Rue du Prieuré (Lakanal kindergarten).
378;2024;Tree-lined Debat Ponsan Avenue;"I propose planting a double row of tall-stem trees on both sides of Debat Ponsan Avenue. This excessively wide and impermeable artery is not green at all. This environmental and urban measure aims to ensure greater comfort of use for pedestrians. Desired spacing between each tree: 8 to 10 meters, respecting private access. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A row of trees (17 ground plantings) can be planted on the odd-numbered side of Debat Ponsan Street. The even-numbered side is affected by a gas network running from north to south of the road, requiring a network diversion beforehand, an operation incompatible with the deadlines/budget associated with this participatory budget. Note, this planting project would eliminate about 17 parking spaces. On the occasion of this redevelopment, the implementation of a bicycle lane on the even-numbered side can also be studied. Finally, the ""Flowers on My Wall"" initiative can be offered to residents to green this street. This initiative, after agreement from the concerned owners, is subject to technical feasibility conditions: no underground networks, no cellars or crawl spaces, and pedestrian continuity to be respected. A technical feasibility analysis will be conducted by the technical services of the city hall and the metropolis, once the request is made by the residents via the online form available on the city's platform.

323;2024;Fun journey on urban nature in the Carmes/Malepère/Marcaissonne district;A strength of the Malepère / Carmes district is the significant presence of wooded areas, yet they are little known to residents. The creation of a permanent fun trail with panels on biodiversity/nature would help to unveil these spaces. The trail would connect the Bois de l'Hers, the Marcaissonne, the wooded areas along Chemin des Carmes and Malepere, the future urban farm, and the upcoming apiaries. Cost: difficult to estimate with our knowledge. 50,000 euros? 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: In this district, there are numerous wooded and green spaces that are of interest for biodiversity. Installing dedicated panels to raise awareness among users about the preservation of biodiversity, as well as respect for vegetation and public spaces in general, meets the needs. It would involve designing (drawings, graphic palettes, etc.) various panels that would discuss biodiversity and the practices to adopt to preserve the environment. Cost: Graphic design involving an illustrator, manufacturing, and installation of several panels in the green spaces.
341;2024;Installation of Public Toilets at Parc de Gironis;Install free sanitary facilities to enable access to sanitation for everyone and enhance health and hygiene in public areas. This type of installation is recommended by the Ministry of Ecological Transition. Numerous models of public toilets exist, including those without connections. The facilities could be installed near football fields, playgrounds, and barbecue areas. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of dry toilets in Gironis Park.
306;2024;Secure Atlanta Avenue with lighting for pedestrians and bicycles (from the section between Columbus dead-end and LIDL, approximately 500m);"Hello, Around 9 PM, many of us leave work and exit the Argoulets metro station heading towards Avenue d'Atlanta, you start walking and thus you are in the dark! Walking or cycling between the metro station and Albi road is very dangerous; We request a project to light the sidewalk. Thank you🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Respecting the financial envelope allocated to each idea, it is possible to provide lighting for the stretch between Colombus dead-end and the LIDL store, over 502 meters."
284;2024;Replant trees in the Place de l'Armée d'Afrique;"Replant dead or removed palm trees (to make room for a billboard) since the redevelopment of the Place de l'Armée d'Afrique to restore charm to the small green space. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A cycling path project is under study, which requires relocating the ""Armée d'Afrique"" commemorative stele and considering a complete requalification of the space to plan new plantings."
401;2024;More bike racks at the Saint-Cyprien library;There is a bike rack in front of the Saint-Cyprien library, but it is very insufficient and there is not enough space for bikes to park. Often, people are forced to lock their bikes to the children's playground fence or the building's emergency staircase. Therefore, an additional bike rack is needed. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Urban furniture such as bike racks cannot be installed directly in front of the Saint-Cyprien library in continuation of the existing one along the facade or in front of the playground for the following reasons: the dedicated areas are too insufficient as they are needed for containers, for the movement of emergency vehicles, and also for pedestrians. The Charles de Fitte alleys offer bike stands about 30 meters from the library entrance. However, additional installations can be added at the corner of Réclusane Street and Charles de Fitte alleys (about 70 meters from the library entrance), subject to the presence of underground networks.
396;2024;Greening and beautification of the cemetery wall on Avenue de la Colonne;"Greening of the planters along the cemetery on Avenue de la Colonne with heat-tolerant, low-maintenance perennial plants. The goals are both ecological and aesthetic:
- Increase biodiversity
- Add more greenery and color to the avenue
- Contribute to the fight against climate change
🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal would be to remove the planters and create pits to plant climbers (similar to the ""flowers on my wall"" initiative). Indeed, planting in pits will ensure better longevity for the plants. However, this proposal will be feasible only after a diagnostic of the cemetery wall's structure confirms the possibility of removing the planters and creating the pits. Moreover, the continuity of the plantings cannot be maintained along the entire length of this wall in order to monitor the wall's condition. On the un-planted sections, a mural with a vegetation theme could be interspersed between two plantings, allowing for visual continuity."
362;2024;Greening of the Cépière roundabout;Saint Simon Road from exit 27 of the ring road to Séverac Boulevard is a high-traffic area with few trees. At the roundabout at exit 27, it is possible to create a micro forest on the roundabout as well as at the junctions of the ring road. There are underutilized green spaces. This would create a barrier zone. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Preservation of the principle of vegetated circles present on the roundabout for the establishment of a micro-forest inspired by the Miyawaki method.
264;2024;Drinking fountain at Place Sainte-Scarbes;At least one tree, one bench, and one drinking fountain on each square. Whether in open soil or in pots, depending on the constraints of Historical Monuments, underground networks, and traffic, envisioning a tree from square to small square: Trinité, Rouaix, Perchepinte, Montoulieu, Stes-Scarbes, Boulbonne, St-Julien, and others with forgotten names: St-Barthélemy (Languedoc/Nazareth), Visitation (Rémusat/Périgord), 3 pillars (3 pillars/St-Charles/Gatien-Arnoult), Pouzonville (St-Charles/Pouzonville/Merly), with fixed bench and drinking fountain, roughly every 100 meters. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal to install a tree, a bench, and a fountain on each square cannot be accepted within the framework of this call for ideas. Some of the locations mentioned in the proposal have already undergone urban developments (some are completed, others are under study). Such projects are part of a broader requalification project (exceeding the amount allocated to the participatory budget), in order not to burden future projects. - Places de la Trinité, Rouaix, Boulbonne: these squares are already qualitatively developed. Drinking fountains are present in the nearby vicinity (between 70m to 250m). The limited free space, pedestrian continuities, emergency access, and existing underground networks do not allow for the installation of a tree and additional urban furniture. - Places Montoulieu, Perchepinte, St-Julien, St-Barthélemy (Languedoc/Nazareth): on these sites, so as not to burden a global project, the installation of a tree, a fountain, and a bench will need to be integrated into a global project (example Place Mage) or soon at Place du Parlement. - Rue des 3 pillars (3 pillars/St-Charles/Gatien-Arnoult): 2 trees will be planted as part of the Toulouse center project in the Arnaud Bernard district, along with chair-type furniture. - Rue Pouzonville (St-Charles/Pouzonville/Merly)/ rue de la Visitation (Rémusat/Périgord): the installation of a tree, a fountain, and a bench is compromised due to networks, terrace footprints, camera poles, pedestrian continuities. The limited free space does not allow for a favorable response to this request. Nevertheless, at Place Saintes-Scarbes, a drinking fountain can be installed subject to the presence of networks and the favorable opinion of the Architecte des Bâtiments de France. The installation of trees seems difficult, however, due to the proximity of the metro tunnel nearby.
381;2024;Educational sound radar on Allée de Brienne;The noise from vehicles rolling on the pavement depends on: 1 - The pavement itself (type and condition of the surface). 2 - The speed of the vehicles. 3 - The eccentricities of some users, motorcycles/cars that wake up the residents of the entire neighborhood in the middle of the night. The urgent actions to be taken are: The repair of the pavement on the Allée with a noise-reducing surface. The installation of acoustic sensors associated with surveillance cameras planned for 2024. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Within the framework of this participatory budget and the associated deadlines and budget, it is not feasible to proceed with the replacement of the pavement surface. However, it is possible to install an educational radar which, with the help of a luminous panel, indicates to the driver whether the noise level of their motor vehicle is compliant or not.
261;2024;Revegetation of Aymé Kunc Square;Over the years, the Aymé Kunc square has lost much of its vegetation due to storms or drought. Just this year, three trees have died (including a young tree that was planted last year and did not survive the heat of this summer). This square deserves to have the dead trees replaced with species adapted to climate change. It also needs replanting of the many other dead shrubs that have never been replaced. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It is proposed to replant 4/5 trees, about twenty shrubs, and also climbing plants on some grilles. In addition, there are plans to replenish the lawn, refurbish the street furniture (benches/trash bins), and possibly add some hardy flowering perennials.
237;2024;Fitness Trail;Develop the public garden next to the Ehpad Françoise de Veyrinas. I suggest that we create a small sports health trail next to the playground. The residents, especially seniors, will be able to improve their lifestyle by engaging in physical activity. This fitness trail can include several installations: elliptical bike, back bars... 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Install modules such as stretching or cardio-training adapted for the Senior public in addition to the existing facilities. The site for installation is to be determined, as the space of the playground is too constrained for this equipment.
310;2024;Create a cycle link from Rond point Pugens to Chemin de Firmis;"The path of Firmis, frequented by many walkers and cyclists, has just been redeveloped in its upper part. A wild connection (acrobatic for cycles and strollers) has spontaneously formed along the Limayrac municipal hall to reach the Pugens roundabout. It would be appropriate to develop it to make this heavily used direct route passable, which requires removing only one or two spaces from the adjacent parking lot. This development is very short (less than 100 m). WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: This idea to develop what is commonly called a ""goat path"" is feasible."
358;2024;Strolling down Jean Mermoz Street;To combat heat islands and enhance this very mineral and unbearable street in the summer (facing South), it would be interesting to plant trees on the South side of the Street. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Creation of green islands at the level of sidewalk widenings and by removing some parking spaces.
226;2024;Inclusive playground at Dortis path;Creation of an inclusive playground next to the Dortis / Josephine Baker school in North Toulouse. The school is set to open and will accommodate a massive influx of students starting January 2024. It would also be interesting to have this type of facility for the children living in the mother-child reception center, which is located right behind! The land where the school was built is perfectly suited for this, given the remaining space! 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It is possible to set up an inclusive playground: with the development of green spaces (grounds, networks, pathways, fences, planting) + drinking fountain.
303;2024;Create pedestrian connections to the Crêtes parking lot;"The Crêtes parking lot is today exclusively reserved for vehicle parking; however, this area sees a significant daily flow of pedestrians crossing the parking lot and weaving between vehicles to reach the subway via the pedestrian crossing located on Avenue Yves Brunaud. The idea would be to create a pedestrian continuity within the parking lot to connect the crosswalks located on either side while reintroducing vegetation to the space that is currently exclusively paved. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is acceptable regarding the creation of pedestrian connections, but it is likely that the re-vegetation cannot be carried out in view of the Express Bike Network project."
369;2024;Creation of a city stadium at La Reynerie;The transformation of a large gravel lot into a CITY STADE FOOT located next to the playground. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Establishment of a multi-sport field at la Reynerie.
376;2024;Educational sound radar on the alleys of Barcelona;When will there be noise radars on the already heavily deteriorated Barcelone avenues, which suffer not only from saturated traffic but also from the excessive noise of two-wheelers at night? 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It is possible to install an educational radar which, with the help of a luminous panel, indicates to the driver whether the noise level of their motor vehicle is compliant or not.
262;2024;Jacobins/Fermat district: limit traffic and speed with road markings.;"Jacobins Convent District / Fermat High Schools: Limit traffic and speed on Lakanal Street (and similar streets) to 10 km/h through the use of speed bumps. The aim is to:
- increase the safety of schoolchildren, high school students, passersby, and tourists
- reduce air pollution for residents
- reduce noise pollution for residents
🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The installation of speed bumps on these roads is not feasible as it is incompatible with the movement of people with reduced mobility. Indeed, since this street is in a meeting zone (limited to 20km/h), it must allow gentle traffic on the roadway, especially for people with reduced mobility, given that the sidewalks are narrow. Note that a comprehensive redevelopment project for Lakanal Street and Maurice Prin Alley is currently under study. Moreover, this area should become more tranquil once the access control at the intersection of Anatole France Square and Deville Street is operational (a coordinated installation as part of the Lois-Rémusat sector calming project). Finally, it should be noted that this street is equipped with chicane parking to reduce speed. Nevertheless, it is proposed to reinforce the road markings with pedestrian logos suitable for meeting zones."
254;2024;Adding a Composter in Ancely;A composter could be added in Ancely near the MJC for the organic waste of nearby residents 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Subject to the approval of the syndicate council and the participation of at least 30 households.
403;2024;Greening of the Bourrassol Parking Lot;White paint and green bollards mark car parking spaces on several streets in the Bourrassol neighborhood, but these are underused and aesthetically lacking areas. It would be far more beneficial to take advantage of these zones to remove the asphalt, restore access to the soil, and sow wildflowers and other small local species. This would enhance biodiversity, combat heat islands, and bring more beauty to the neighborhood. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A de-asphalting project could be implemented in the existing parking area at the entrance of the street. Trees and flowers could be planted in the parking area at the back of the lot, continuing those existing in the playground area, and would create a vegetated open space set back from the road. This project could eliminate about 19 parking spaces. The remaining parking spaces along Bourrassol street, totaling 27 (including 2 for disabled access and 2 reserved for electric vehicle charging), could be de-asphalted and covered with grassy honeycomb slabs, grassed paving stones, etc. The proposal for greening is not retained for the streets of the Bourrassol neighborhood because this project would be too extensive (the parking spaces being simply marked on the road, are not protected), within the framework of the budget allocated to the participatory budget, and the trees would represent an obstacle on the roadway.
338;2024;Installation of dry toilets in Place des Tibaous;During public events and activities in the squares (community association forums, etc.), only the church square in Saint Simon is equipped with public toilets. As activities increase in the Tibaous square, it would be wise to plan for a public toilet for this square, and, by anticipation, for the Guilhermy public square. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of dry toilets in the Tibaous square.
326;2024;Greening of the corner of Louis Vitet Street and Joseph Roques Street;"At the corner of Rue Louis Vitet and Rue Joseph Roques, there is a ""green"" space filled with brambles and creeping plants that host a small fauna and dry out a lot in the summer. It would be advisable to plant some trees in the center to provide shade for everyone, as well as to cool the adjacent streets and sidewalks. Another idea would be to create a hedge along the border to establish a true flora/fauna biotope and to protect/regenerate the soil. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Since the idea does not require roadwork, it is acceptable."
280;2024;More trash cans and ashtrays on the Maourine square;Since there is a budget, plan to clean the Maourine square and the northern Borderouge neighborhood more often to make it more pleasant to live in: more trash bins, ashtrays, and daily cleaning would make our neighborhood much more pleasant to live in and more attractive. Sometimes it takes very little to make a place pleasant to live in so that residents truly inhabit it and to attract local businesses to set up shop. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The Maourine square is already well equipped with bins (9), and it is possible to add 3 more.
360;2024;Refurbishment of the pathways in Biscotte Park;The pathways in Biscotte Park are very damaged, and the passage of Metropolitan vehicles creates ruts. The pathways could be renovated but with a permeable covering instead of the current concrete. Their width could be increased to accommodate the vehicles used for park maintenance. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Redoing the existing pedestrian pathways and creating new pedestrian segments in Biscotte Park.
347;2024;Greening of the sidewalk at the corner of Avenue de Muret and Rue Axel Duboul;In front of Léonidas and the greengrocer, there is a large tarred area that is lifeless. I suggest transforming this small square by planting flowers directly in the ground instead of in pots (to avoid watering too often), and by adding benches to make the place more welcoming and attractive for the merchants. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Removal of the tarred surfaces in favor of shrubby plants, and creation of a resting area with the installation of benches.
385;2024;Create bicycle parking spaces on Rue Réclusane;Réclusane Street has too few parking spaces for bicycles, especially near Armand Duportal School. Cyclists park on the barriers in front of the school, leaving little room for pedestrians to pass. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal to install bicycle racks near Armand Duportal School has not been accepted because, as part of the redevelopment and requalification of Réclusane Street from the sidewalk in the summer of 2023, several bicycle racks have been installed on the sidewalk opposite the school and at the entrance of Dames de la Porte alley and Réclusane Street. However, the addition of one or two bicycle racks will be considered in continuation of those installed opposite the school, on Réclusane Street.
307;2024;Install bike racks in front of the businesses on Route d'Agde;Hello, Riding a bike is great, but it's also necessary to be able to stop and lock one's bike in front of shops, especially throughout sector 4.2 and particularly on route d'Agde. It is important to encourage businesses to make this investment in front of their storefronts (financial and/or technical assistance) when the parking is private, and to continue developing the availability of bike racks on public property. Thank you🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Bike racks are installed on public property as soon as possible, when space allows, and will be on route d'Agde as part of the express bike network.
318;2024;Rehabilitate Raspail Square;Raspail Square could have a lot of charm but currently lacks attractiveness due to very poor facilities. Therefore, I propose making it one of the key points for local interaction by installing some basic structures: workout bars, a book-sharing box, compost bins, chess/checkers tables, etc. A fountain could also brighten it up! 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The idea is acceptable except for the provision of a fountain, which would not fit within the maximum budget allocated to each idea of the participatory budget.
266;2024;Danger: Intersection between Lafayette Street and Rempart Villeneuve Street;Urgent need to review the signage at this intersection, as there is heavy traffic and it is very dangerous. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: This intersection experiences significant car and pedestrian flow. Therefore, it is proposed to enhance the road markings on Rue du Rempart Villeneuve at the speed bump plateau. Implementing the street code can further secure this area.
353;2024;Creation of a chess playing area;"Many chess players in Toulouse cannot meet; it is enough to set up, at very little cost, a table and a giant chessboard (4m/4m) in a small green space, along with the pieces. Very quickly, players and onlookers of all generations gather around the game. Geneva, Paris, Lausanne, and other cities have successfully created such meeting spaces. Do not hesitate to contact me for advice with pleasure. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PROVIDE: Installation of furniture in public spaces for playing chess."
398;2024;Implement photoluminescent paint marking on the Coubertin and Garigliano Bridges.;"The idea: to create simple graphic compositions on bike paths using photoluminescent paint that stores daylight and reflects it when night falls for a duration of 10 hours. This is to make the bike path visible at night for about ten hours. The main goal is to secure sections of bike paths at night and to make the bike paths attractive and aesthetic. On Pont Coubertin/Garigliano? 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal to create bike paths with photoluminescent paint may be feasible on the Pierre de Coubertin and Garigliano Bridges. However, there are some reservations: A test was conducted on Velasquez Street and the path of La Crabe in Toulouse in 2022, but this application did not meet expectations regarding the duration of luminescence mentioned in the product sheets. Moreover, this product is not approved for ""standard"" use and can only be used in experiments. The main reasons cited are: 1. The photoluminescent property is barely visible in a place that is already poorly lit, which would be the case on these two bridges equipped with street lamps on either side of the road. 2. The duration of the luminescence is far from the announced 10 hours but rather around 3 hours. 3. The lifespan of the luminescence deteriorates over time. Finally, this process seems very costly considering that it does not provide the expected service."
365;2024;Development of the small Bagatelle grove;It would be necessary to add more benches and chairs to Bagatelle Park 2. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of furniture (benches, picnic tables...) in the small Bagatelle wood to create a resting area.
240;2024;Setting up tables in Parc des Cèdres;It would be necessary to install more tables at Parc des Cèdres. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of 2 to 5 picnic tables near the playground and in the park.
234;2024;Lardenne School Bike Garages;"There are very few bike racks at Lardenne Elementary School; it would be great to have more and would encourage parents and children! 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: An alternative solution is proposed: installation of bike racks in both schools: kindergarten and elementary."
238;2024;North Capelles Children's Games;"There are not enough playgrounds for children in the northern part of Chemin des Capelles. There used to be some near the agility area by the Touch which were removed; they should be replaced, or perhaps elsewhere along the greenway. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The location and land are yet to be determined: proposal for a multi-activity structure for ages 3-10, a drinking fountain, and a shade sail."
297;2024;Two-way cycle lane on Rue Falguière;"Cycling against the flow of traffic on Rue de la Concorde and Rue Alexandre Falguière is currently very dangerous with oncoming cars that pass dangerously close. There should be a secure bike lane at least in the opposite direction by removing parking on one side of the street. It is also necessary to consider reducing traffic as much as possible to calm the street. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Such an arrangement cannot be implemented on Rue de la Concorde, under this scheme, due to the presence of a terrace set up on the sidewalk (establishment Le Concorde) and prior infrastructure works that are incompatible with the deadlines and costs associated with this participatory budget. For Rue Falguière, a contraflow bike lane can be considered but presents the following constraints:
- necessity to move the recently installed planter, in consultation with the residents, at the corner of Rue Saint-Papoul (interruption of the bike lane continuity);
- interruption of the bike lane arrangement at the intersection with Rue de la Concorde (narrowing of the lane at the level of the small square);
- arrangement can only be made after the intersection with Rue Saint-Henri, the 2 lanes on the side of Place Roquelaine must be preserved as part of the project for a green square on the square;
- removal of about twenty parking spaces."
355;2024;Adorning the central reservations on Rue Henri Barbusse;In the summer, the heat is suffocating between the road to Spain and rue de l’Ourq. Yet, there are huge tarred areas that serve no purpose. Instead, we could plant trees and plants at their bases to finally cool down this area. WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Removal of the tarred islands and planting of low vegetation at the corner of rue Henri Barbusse and the road to Spain.
340;2024;Install sports equipment for seniors in Gironis Park;Set up a sports area in Gironis Park: stationary bikes, etc., similar to the one in Biscotte Park targeted at the elderly and those with mobility issues. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Install sports equipment for seniors in Gironis Park.
354;2024;Securing the greenway at the intersection of Camille Langlade dead-end street;The bike path coming from the dike is not secure at its exit onto the dead-end Camille Langlade street in front of number 9. Several cyclists have been frightened at this exit, and there is a risk of serious accidents. To address this issue, a protected crossing should be marked and this exit should be indicated by signs. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of anti-parking devices without hindering sidewalk accessibility. Creation of a bike sluice in the continuation of the bike path to slow down vehicles while creating a transition space for bicycles.
248;2024;Electric islands around the Zénith for food trucks and circuses;There could be electric hubs around the Zénith, especially on rue de l'Abbé Jules Lemire, to allow food trucks and circuses to connect and thus avoid the use of polluting and noisy diesel generators currently in use. This would improve the air quality of the neighborhood and reduce noise pollution during these events. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: To be studied depending on the locations of installation. Consider between 3 and 5 terminals.
302;2024;Install human shape detection lighting on Rue des Pavots;Street lighting on poppy streets (and other residential streets with little road traffic) could be reduced: lighting every second (or third) lamp after midnight, or with brightness reduced to 25% unless vehicle or pedestrian movement is detected. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Shape detection can be installed on these streets, allowing the device to remain at 10% if no human form is detected on the street, then instantly switch to 100% upon detection.
342;2024;Securing the sidewalks in front of the Al Tempo music school - Mazellier Street;Anti-parking plots in front of the Al Tempo music school on Mazellier Street, as well as in front of the neighboring residences. Avoid chaotic and abusive parking that can pose a danger (especially parking on the sidewalk). Avoid noise pollution and pollution: motorists stay in their cars with the engine running and the air conditioning on while waiting for their child's music class to end. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Prevent parking on the sidewalk of Mazellier Street in front of the Al Tempo music school by installing bollards.
386;2024;Bicycle parking on Maurice Sarraut avenues;Use the unused space in front of the residence at 29 allées Maurice Sarraut to install Bike/Motorcycle parking, which is really lacking on this street. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The proposal to establish bike parking in front of the residence at 29 allées Maurice Sarraut has been accepted. Three bike racks will be installed.
228;2024;Dog Park;Installation of a dog park at Parc du Soleil d'Or. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: It is possible to expand the existing dedicated space.
257;2024;Cleanliness facilities near the pedestrian path at the Arènes Romaines tram stop.;The pedestrian path between the Arènes Romaines tram stop and 36 chemin de la Flambère is often dirty with litter on the ground and dog feces. Although it is clear that some people are not well-mannered, would it be possible to add a trash can and dog waste bags on each side of the path? 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of dog waste bag dispensers and trash cans along the path.
233;2024;Slowing down and securing Salinié road;"The Salinie road is a heavily trafficked axis and will continue to be so with the new constructions in the neighborhood. This results in significant car traffic and the 30 km/h speed limit now visible on the road is not being respected. The sidewalks are very narrow in some places, so either adding speed bumps or creating ""chicanes"" would be necessary. I hope this would slow down traffic and reduce the danger for us and our children, as well as pollution! 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A project is already under study. Vehicle counts have been done and the need has already been identified. Given the existing speed moderating elements, there is a proposal to install an educational radar."
399;2024;Renovate the old wall of the public garden in the Pays d'Oc;The ancient wall made of bricks and pebbles in the public garden of the Pays d'Oc, on François Longaud Street, is severely deteriorated, to the extent that in one place, it is so hole-ridden that one can see through to the other side. It is necessary to renovate this heritage in a traditional manner (using lime mortar) to halt its degradation and enhance its value. It is, moreover, the last remnant along with the century-old plane trees of the public garden of the former Notre-Dame de Charité du Refuge monastery, which was demolished at the end of the 1970s. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The garden wall will be renovated using traditional materials. To preserve the current identity of the wall, the renovation will involve replacing the missing pebbles and repairing the lime mortar. The wall's refurbishment will be subject to the opinion of the Architecte des Bâtiments de France.
253;2024;Report and add a yield sign at the pedestrian/cyclist crossing at Laporte path.;"Currently, the crossing is over a speed bump that encourages slowing down, but there are no signs indicating that cyclists or pedestrians may be crossing. In summer, it can pass with the clarity of the days; however, in winter, it's just accident-prone. The example to follow is just a few meters away at 11 chemin de la Crabe where the crossing is prioritized for cyclists/pedestrians over motor vehicles: a yield sign and panels inform drivers. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Identified project currently under study along the entire route of REV 10 – prioritization of cycle crossings at intersections. In connection with the association ""2 pieds 2 roues""."
368;2024;Establishment of a fitness trail in the park near Bourliaguet School;For those wishing to engage in sports in the neighborhood, it would be necessary to install a fitness trail in the park next to Bourliaguet School. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of various fitness equipment in the park near Bourliaguet School.
371;2024;Creation of an early childhood game near Simone Veil school;Necessity to establish play areas for early childhood (under 6 years old). The current play areas are not suitable for these ages. They are already occupied by older children, which makes the play areas dangerous for the younger ones. This development must be accompanied by the installation of benches and tables. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Development of a play area for 3-6 year olds in order to separate the uses and free up the existing play area for those over 6 years old.
259;2024;Arrow to turn right at the light 133 avenue des Arènes Romaines (towards chemin de la Flambère);At 133 Avenue des Arènes Romaines, when we have Blagnac behind us and wish to head towards Chemin de la Flambère, there is a traffic light at the tram stop. At this location, it forces a stop when red, even though it would be possible to continue if one wishes to turn right onto Chemin de la Flambère (no crossing traffic). Therefore, it would be good to add a blinking arrow to allow this and thus ease the traffic flow. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The project must be studied by the Mobility Directorate concerning traffic lights and will have to be submitted to the STRMTG: State Services in charge of the tramway.
244;2024;Development of Rue de la Cressonière by adding greenery;Landscaping of Rue de la Créssonière with tree planting and the possibility of creating a central pedestrian walkway. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Rue de la Cressonière, a tertiary local service road and not a priority in terms of the neighborhood's needs. Soil quality needs to be checked and parking removed.
367;2024;Securing Jean Gilles' Maury Park;The Park is dangerous for everyone, especially children. Scooters and bikes speed through it. It is necessary to enclose the Park to secure it and prevent an imminent accident. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: This area is not open to motorized two-wheelers, which are not allowed to circulate here. Unfortunately, these violations are frequent. However, simply installing a fence will not prevent acts of incivility and should not confine the users of this park. It is recommended to install a barrier enclosure with a height of 1m, supplemented by swinging gates that hinder the access of two-wheelers.
330;2024;"Implementation of ""shape detection"" lighting on rue Lefranc de Pompignan";"Installation of motion-sensing lighting on rue Lefranc de Pompignan🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: A very good idea which, with the addition of the ""shape detection"" option, will allow the device to remain at 10% if no human shape is detected in the street, then instantly switch to 100% upon detection."
372;2024;Installation of a bike repair stand at La Reynerie;Fleury: Place André Abbal (Reynerie): It would be practical to install a repair stand for bicycles, on which we could hang them, with tools available that would be welded to it. This would allow us to repair the bikes ourselves, while learning a bit about mechanics. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of a bicycle repair station near existing bike paths.
356;2024;Remove the asphalt from the parking spaces on Bernadette Street;I propose removing the asphalt from the parking spaces on Bernadette Street. Indeed, why keep tar in an area where no one drives? Instead, we could do like the Téléo parking. Cars would still be able to park as before, but the advantage is that water could seep through and replenish the groundwater, which is very useful in the summer. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Implementation of a clear draining concrete in the parking spaces on Bernadette Street. Opportunity for greening the central island and some parking spaces.
230;2024;Installation of waste bins for dog feces in Sept Deniers;Install in the Sept-Deniers neighborhood, trash bins and bags for animal waste. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The Sept-Deniers neighborhood already has a number of canine waste dispensers: (E Guyaux Street, corner of J Gayral Street/Troènes Street, corner of Troènes Street/Peupliers Street, Flourac passage, at 23 chemin des Sept Deniers, 2 at the level of the Ponts Jumeaux leisure base as well as at the garden of the Ludothèque near Place Job). We propose to add 3 units (dispensers and baskets), one at the level of the Ponts Jumeaux leisure base and two others in the green space between chemin des Sept Deniers and Troènes Street.
370;2024;Set up tables and chairs at Jean Gilles' Maury Park;There are not enough tables and chairs to accommodate the number of people who frequent the park. There is a need to install tables and chairs anchored to the ground to develop this vast area and provide a place to sit. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: Installation of furniture (benches, picnic tables...) in Maury Park to create a resting area.
374;2024;Improving the cleanliness of the Jean Gilles playground;Necessity to renovate Jean Gilles playground. It would be good to install a new floor covering such as a mat, to enclose the children's play area to make it safer, and to install equipment to keep it cleaner. It would also be necessary to increase the number of games for children. 🔎 WHAT THE SERVICES PLAN: The floor is in good condition, it only requires deep cleaning. The existing fence is in good condition with a gate. To improve cleanliness, two additional bins could complement the existing one.
