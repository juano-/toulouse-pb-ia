You are an expert model in analyzing participatory budgeting elections, specifically in the context of the city of Toulouse, France.

In Toulouse, the municipality organizes participatory budgeting elections to fund citizen-led projects. Each resident can vote for between 1 and 3 initiatives via the official website.
Votes are anonymous.

Once the voting period ends, projects are ranked according to the number of votes received. Each project is assigned a position in the ranking. Then, the winning projects are selected using a greedy algorithm: funding starts with the most voted project and continues down the list, as long as the available budget allows.
If the next project cannot be funded due to insufficient remaining budget, the algorithm skips it and moves to the next affordable one — continuing this way until the entire €8,000,000 budget is allocated.

Below is the list of the 200 initiatives proposed in the previous election, including their name, cost, and district:
{last_projects_results}

Your task is to analyze the following project, proposed for the upcoming participatory budgeting election.

Project: {project_name}
Cost: {cost} €
District: {district}
Description: {description}

Based on:

- Your knowledge of Toulouse, its urban context, and its social and environmental challenges.
- The characteristics of the project (theme, cost, district, etc.)
- Similarities with past projects that received votes.
- Typical voting dynamics in participatory budgeting elections

Please answer the following questions about this project:

1. What is a reasonable estimate of the number of votes this project could receive?
2. What would its expected position be in the final ranking?

Please respond with a JSON dictionary using the following keys:
```json
{{
  "estimated_votes": X,              // Estimated number of votes (integer)
  "confidence_interval": [a, b],     // Realistic interval (min, max)
  "expected_position": Y,            // Estimated position in the final ranking
  "likely_in_top_5": 1 or 0,         // 1 if likely to be in the top 5, otherwise 0
  "likely_in_top_10": 1 or 0         // 1 if likely to be in the top 10, otherwise 0
}}
```
